Trynka papers talking about relevant histone marks and similar studies


Use of epigenetic marks as drg targest mainly DMNTs and HDACs inhibitors in Ballestar and Li. It explains there are two main ways to target epigenetic mechanisms : directly modifying enzymes that catalyse the epigenetic changes  or by targeting factors that inderictly affect global epigenetic profiles.
