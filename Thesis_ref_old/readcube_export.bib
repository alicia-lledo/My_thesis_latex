  abstract={To increase our understanding of psoriasis, we used high-throughput complementary {DNA} sequencing {(RNA-seq)} to assay the transcriptomes of lesional psoriatic and normal skin. We sequenced polyadenylated {RNA-derived} complementary {DNAs} from 92 psoriatic and 82 normal punch biopsies, generating an average of approximately 38 million single-end 80-bp reads per sample. Comparison of 42 samples examined by both {RNA-seq} and microarray revealed marked differences in sensitivity, with transcripts identified only by {RNA-seq} having much lower expression than those also identified by microarray. {RNA-seq} identified many more differentially expressed transcripts enriched in immune system processes. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis {(WGCNA)} revealed multiple modules of coordinately expressed epidermal differentiation genes, overlapping significantly with genes regulated by the long noncoding {RNA} {TINCR,} its target gene, staufen-1 {(STAU1),} the p63 target gene {ZNF750,} and its target {KLF4.} Other coordinately expressed modules were enriched for lymphoid and/or myeloid signature transcripts and genes induced by {IL-17} in keratinocytes. Dermally expressed genes were significantly downregulated in psoriatic biopsies, most likely because of expansion of the epidermal compartment. These results show the power of {WGCNA} to elucidate gene regulatory circuits in psoriasis, and emphasize the influence of tissue architecture in both differential expression and coexpression analysis.},

We isolated a surprising number of nonexpanded T cells from normal skin. To validate this finding, we counted T cells in sections of normal skin and determined that there are approximately 1 x 10(6) T cells/cm(2) normal skin and an estimated 2 x 10(10) T cells in the entire skin surface, nearly twice the number of T cells in the circulation. Moreover, we estimate that 98\% of {CLA(+)} effector memory T cells are resident in normal skin under resting conditions.

  abstract={The skin forms an effective barrier between the organism and the environment preventing invasion of pathogens and fending off chemical and physical assaults, as well as the unregulated loss of water and solutes. In this review we provide an overview of several components of the physical barrier, explaining how barrier function is regulated and altered in dermatoses. The physical barrier is mainly localized in the stratum corneum {(SC)} and consists of protein-enriched cells (corneocytes with cornified envelope and cytoskeletal elements, as well as corneodesmosomes) and lipid-enriched intercellular domains. The nucleated epidermis also contributes to the barrier through tight, gap and adherens junctions, as well as through desmosomes and cytoskeletal elements. During epidermal differentiation lipids are synthesized in the keratinocytes and extruded into the extracellular domains, where they form extracellular lipid-enriched layers. The cornified cell envelope, a tough protein/lipid polymer structure, resides below the cytoplasmic membrane on the exterior of the corneocytes. Ceramides A and B are covalently bound to cornified envelope proteins and form the backbone for the subsequent addition of free ceramides, free fatty acids and cholesterol in the {SC.} Filaggrin is cross-linked to the cornified envelope and aggregates keratin filaments into macrofibrils. Formation and maintenance of barrier function is influenced by cytokines, 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium. Changes in epidermal differentiation and lipid composition lead to a disturbed skin barrier, which allows the entry of environmental allergens, immunological reaction and inflammation in atopic dermatitis. A disturbed skin barrier is important for the pathogenesis of contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.},

  abstract={Recent genome-wide association studies {(GWAS)} have identified multiple genetic risk factors for psoriasis, but data on their association with age of onset have been marginally explored. The goal of this study was to evaluate known risk alleles of psoriasis for association with age of psoriasis onset in three well-defined case-only cohorts totaling 1,498 psoriasis patients. We selected 39 genetic variants from psoriasis {GWAS} and tested these variants for association with age of psoriasis onset in a meta-analysis. We found that rs10484554 and rs12191877 near {HLA-C} and rs17716942 near {IFIH1} were associated with age of psoriasis onset with false discovery rate \&\#x3c; 0.05. The association between rs17716942 and age of onset was not replicated in a fourth independent cohort of 489 patients (). The imputed {HLA-C\&\#x2a;06:02} allele demonstrated a much stronger association with age of psoriasis onset than rs10484554 and rs12191877. We conclude that despite the discovery of numerous psoriasis risk alleles, {HLA-C\&\#x2a;06:02} still plays the most important role in determining the age of onset of psoriasis. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the contribution of other risk alleles, including {IFIH1,} to age of psoriasis onset.},

  abstract={Psoriatic arthritis {(PsA)} occurs in approximately 30\% of psoriasis patients. Understanding the similarities and differences in the etiology of these related diseases may highlight pathways for intervention and allow risk prediction in the future. Both are complex diseases in which environmental susceptibility factors trigger disease in genetically susceptible individuals. In recent years, genome-wide association studies have been highly successful in identifying genetic susceptibility factors for psoriasis. Most of the psoriasis loci tested so far are also associated with {PsA.} For example, associations of {HLA-Cw*06} and the {IL12B} and {IL23R} genes are well-established with both conditions. More recently, analysis of psoriasis genome-wide association studies in a {PsA} subgroup has also implicated {IL23A,} {TNFAIP3,} and {TNIP1} genetic variants as conferring risk to {PsA.} One study has suggested that late cornified envelope {(LCE)} gene polymorphisms are associated with psoriasis but not {PsA.} However, this finding was not confirmed by a second study. Similarly, association of the 5q31 gene region encompassing the {IL13} gene has been reported with {PsA} but not psoriasis by one group, but this awaits confirmation in other series. Dedicated genome-wide association studies of {PsA} are underway and are likely to reveal further insights into why some patients with psoriasis develop arthritis whilst the majority do not.},

  abstract={The {ASC} (apoptosis speck-like protein) is a key component of multimeric protein complexes that mediate inflammation and host defence. Comprising a {PYD} {(Pyrin)} domain and a {CARD} (caspase activation and recruitment domain), {ASC} functions downstream of {NLRs} (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors) and {AIM2} (absent in melanoma 2) through the formation of supramolecular structures termed inflammasomes. However, the mechanism underlying {ASC} signalling and its dependency on oligomeric arrangements in inflammasome formation remain poorly understood. When expressed in cells, {ASC} forms discrete foci (called 'specks') typically with one speck per cell. We employed a {BiFC} (bimolecular fluorescence complementation) system to investigate and visualize {ASC} foci formation in living cells. We demonstrated that the {CARD} of {ASC} plays a central role in {ASC} inflammasome assembly, representing the minimal unit capable of forming foci in conjunction with the caspase 1 {CARD.} Mutational studies point to multiple surfaces on the {ASC} {CARD} and two predominant areas on the caspase 1 {CARD} mediating the formation of {ASC/caspase} 1 foci. The lack of foci formation for {ASC} {CARD} mutants correlates with a loss of {IL-1beta} (interleukin 1beta) processing in response to {NLRP} {(NLR} family, {PYD} domain-containing) 3 or {AIM2} agonists in {RAW264.7} cell reconstitution assays. Analogously, we show that productive formation of the Salmonella typhimurium-induced {NLRC4} {(NLR} family {CARD} domain-containing protein 4) inflammasome is dependent on {ASC-CARD-mediated} platform formation. Thus the results of the present study depict a central role of {CARDs} in the formation of {ASC} signalling platforms and provide an important tool for investigation of {CARD-dependent} networks.},

  abstract={Psoriasis is a common T cell-mediated autoimmune disorder where primary onset of skin lesions is followed by chronic relapses. Progress in defining the mechanism for initiation of pathological events has been hampered by the lack of a relevant experimental model in which psoriasis develops spontaneously. We present a new animal model in which skin lesions spontaneously developed when symptomless prepsoriatic human skin was engrafted onto {AGR129} mice, deficient in type I and type {II} interferon receptors and for the recombination activating gene 2. Upon engraftment, resident human T cells in prepsoriatic skin underwent local proliferation. T cell proliferation was crucial for development of a psoriatic phenotype because blocking of T cells led to inhibition of psoriasis development. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha was a key regulator of local T cell proliferation and subsequent disease development. Our observations highlight the importance of resident T cells in the context of lesional tumor necrosis factor-alpha production during development of a psoriatic lesion. These findings underline the importance of resident immune cells in psoriasis and will have implications for new therapeutic strategies for psoriasis and other T cell-mediated diseases.},

  abstract={Previous studies have narrowed the interval containing {PSORS1,} the psoriasis-susceptibility locus in the major histocompatibility complex {(MHC),} to an \{\textless\}300-kb region containing {HLA-C} and at least 10 other genes. In an effort to identify the {PSORS1} gene, we cloned and completely sequenced this region from both chromosomes of five individuals. Two of the sequenced haplotypes were associated with psoriasis (risk), and the other eight were clearly unassociated (nonrisk). Comparison of sequence of the two risk haplotypes identified a 298-kb region of homology, extending from just telomeric of {HLA-B} to the {HCG22} gene, which was flanked by clearly nonhomologous regions. Similar haplotypes cloned from unrelated individuals had nearly identical sequence. Combinatorial analysis of exonic variations in the known genes of the candidate interval revealed that {HCG27,} {PSORS1C3,} {OTF3,} {TCF19,} {HCR,} {STG,} and {HCG22} bore no alleles unique to risk haplotypes among the 10 sequenced haplotypes. {SPR1} and {SEEK1} both had messenger {RNA} alleles specific to risk haplotypes, but only {HLA-C} and {CDSN} yielded protein alleles unique to risk. The risk alleles of {HLA-C} and {CDSN} {(HLA-Cw6} and {CDSN*TTC)} were genotyped in 678 families with early-onset psoriasis; 620 of these families were also typed for 34 microsatellite markers spanning the {PSORS1} interval. Recombinant haplotypes retaining {HLA-Cw6} but lacking {CDSN*TTC} were significantly associated with psoriasis, whereas recombinants retaining {CDSN*TTC} but lacking {HLA-Cw6} were not associated, despite good statistical power. By grouping recombinants with similar breakpoints, the most telomeric quarter of the 298-kb candidate interval could be excluded with high confidence. These results strongly suggest that {HLA-Cw6} is the {PSORS1} risk allele that confers susceptibility to early-onset psoriasis.},

It mediates its biological effects via interaction with the receptors {ST2} {(IL-1RL1)} and {IL-1} receptor accessory protein {(IL-1RAcP),} both of which are widely expressed, particularly by innate immune cells and T helper 2 {(Th2)} cells. {IL-33} strongly induces Th2 cytokine production from these cells and can promote the pathogenesis of Th2-related disease such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and anaphylaxis. However, {IL-33} has shown various protective effects in cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiac remodeling. Thus, the effects of {IL-33} are either pro- or anti-inflammatory depending on the disease and the model. In this review the role of {IL-33} in the inflammation of several disease pathologies will be discussed, with particular emphasis on recent advances.},

As a prevalent T lymphocyte mediated disorder, psoriasis, as well as the side effects associated with its treatment, affects patients globally. In this review, recent progress is discussed in the areas of genetics, the immunological synapse, the untangling of the cytokine web and signaling pathways, xenotransplantation models, and the growing use of selectively targeted therapies. Since psoriasis is currently incurable, new management strategies are proposed to replace previous serendipitous approaches. Such strategic transition from serendipity to the use of novel selective agents aimed at defined targets in psoriatic lesions is moving rapidly from research benches to the bedsides of patients with this chronic and debilitating disease.},

  abstract={Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis characterized by hyperproliferative keratinocytes {(KC).} The skin lesions are infiltrated by T cells, which secrete gamma interferon {(gamma-IFN)} and are believed to be necessary to maintain the psoriatic phenotype. In normal {KC,} {gamma-IFN} is a potent inhibitor of proliferation, but proliferation of {KC} persists in psoriatic plaques despite the presence of {gamma-IFN.} Immunostaining of interferon regulatory factor-1 {(IRF-1)} revealed that {IRF-1} was localized to the basal cells of the epidermis in normal and in nonlesional psoriatic skin, but was suprabasal or completely absent in lesional psoriatic skin. This finding led to the hypothesis that abnormal signaling in the {gamma-IFN} pathway may occur in psoriatic {KC.} To test this hypothesis, we measured activation of {IRF-1} and signal transducer and activator of transcription {(STAT)-1alpha} transcription factors in {KC} after stimulation with {gamma-IFN.} Primary cultures of {KC} from normal and nonlesional psoriatic skin were stimulated with {gamma-IFN} and subsequent transcription factor activation was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Psoriatic {KC} showed a reduced induction of {IRF-1} and {STAT-1alpha} activation after stimulation with {gamma-IFN,} compared with normal {KC.} Reduced activation of {IRF-1} and {STAT-1alpha} in response to {gamma-IFN} indicates a fundamental defect in the growth and differentiation control of psoriatic {KC} in the absence of the influence of other cell types.},

Both {IL12B} markers showed highly significant association with psoriasis in the case-control (rs3212227, odds ratio {(OR)=1.62,} P=1.7 x 10(-15); rs6887695, {OR=1.49,} P=2.7 x 10(-15)) and in the family-based analysis (rs3212227, P=2.2 x 10(-3); rs6887695, P=1.7 x 10(-3)). The {IL23R} {SNPs} also showed significant association in the cases and controls (rs7530511, {OR=1.22,} P=3.9 x 10(-3); rs11209026, {OR=1.40,} P=3.8 x 10(-4)). For both genes, common risk haplotypes were identified whose statistical significance approached {(IL23R)} or exceeded {(IL12B)} genome-wide criteria. We found no statistical evidence for interactions of these haplotypes with {HLA-Cw6.} Our results confirm associations between {IL12B} and {IL23R} and psoriasis in Caucasians, and provide a genetic basis for the clinical association between psoriasis and Crohn's disease.},

Here we identify the antimicrobial peptide {LL37} (also known as {CAMP)} as the key factor that mediates {pDC} activation in psoriasis, a common autoimmune disease of the skin. {LL37} converts inert {self-DNA} into a potent trigger of interferon production by binding the {DNA} to form aggregated and condensed structures that are delivered to and retained within early endocytic compartments in {pDCs} to trigger Toll-like receptor 9. Thus, our data uncover a fundamental role of an endogenous antimicrobial peptide in breaking innate tolerance to {self-DNA} and suggest that this pathway may drive autoimmunity in psoriasis.},

  abstract={The human body contains thousands of unique cell types, each with specialized functions. Cell identity is governed in large part by gene transcription programs, which are determined by regulatory elements encoded in {DNA.} To identify regulatory elements active in seven cell lines representative of diverse human cell types, we used {DNase-seq} and {FAIRE-seq} {(Formaldehyde} Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements) to map  open chromatin.  Over 870,000 {DNaseI} or {FAIRE} sites, which correspond tightly to nucleosome-depleted regions, were identified across the seven cell lines, covering nearly 9\% of the genome. The combination of {DNaseI} and {FAIRE} is more effective than either assay alone in identifying likely regulatory elements, as judged by coincidence with transcription factor binding locations determined in the same cells. Open chromatin common to all seven cell types tended to be at or near transcription start sites and to be coincident with {CTCF} binding sites, while open chromatin sites found in only one cell type were typically located away from transcription start sites and contained {DNA} motifs recognized by regulators of cell-type identity. We show that open chromatin regions bound by {CTCF} are potent insulators. We identified clusters of open regulatory elements {(COREs)} that were physically near each other and whose appearance was coordinated among one or more cell types. Gene expression and {RNA} Pol {II} binding data support the hypothesis that {COREs} control gene activity required for the maintenance of cell-type identity. This publicly available atlas of regulatory elements may prove valuable in identifying noncoding {DNA} sequence variants that are causally linked to human disease.},

  abstract={Studies attempting to functionally interpret complex-disease susceptibility loci by {GWAS} and {eQTL} integration have predominantly employed microarrays to quantify gene-expression. {RNA-Seq} has the potential to discover a more comprehensive set of {eQTLs} and illuminate the underlying molecular consequence. We examine the functional outcome of 39 variants associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus {(SLE)} through the integration of {GWAS} and {eQTL} data from the {TwinsUK} microarray and {RNA-Seq} cohort in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We use conditional analysis and a Bayesian colocalisation method to provide evidence of a shared causal-variant, then compare the ability of each quantification type to detect disease relevant {eQTLs} and {eGenes.} We discovered the greatest frequency of candidate-causal {eQTLs} using exon-level {RNA-Seq,} and identified novel {SLE} susceptibility genes (e.g. {NADSYN1} and {TCF7)} that were concealed using microarrays, including four non-coding {RNAs.} Many of these {eQTLs} were found to influence the expression of several genes, supporting the notion that risk haplotypes may harbour multiple functional effects. Novel {SLE} associated splicing events were identified in the T-reg restricted transcription factor, {IKZF2,} and other candidate genes (e.g. {WDFY4)} through {asQTL} mapping using the Geuvadis cohort. We have significantly increased our understanding of the genetic control of gene-expression in {SLE} by maximising the leverage of {RNA-Seq} and performing integrative {GWAS-eQTL} analysis against gene, exon, and splice-junction quantifications. We conclude that to better understand the true functional consequence of regulatory variants, quantification by {RNA-Seq} should be performed at the exon-level as a minimum, and run in parallel with gene and splice-junction level quantification.},

  abstract={Gene expression profiling of psoriasis has driven research advances and may soon provide the basis for clinical applications. For expression profiling studies, {RNA-seq} is now a competitive technology, but {RNA-seq} results may differ from those obtained by microarray. We therefore compared findings obtained by {RNA-seq} with those from eight microarray studies of psoriasis. {RNA-seq} and microarray datasets identified similar numbers of differentially expressed genes {(DEGs),} with certain genes uniquely identified by each technology. Correspondence between platforms and the balance of increased to decreased {DEGs} was influenced by {mRNA} abundance, {GC} content, and gene length. Weakly expressed genes, genes with low {GC} content, and long genes were all biased toward decreased expression in psoriasis lesions. The strength of these trends differed among array datasets, most likely due to variations in {RNA} quality. Gene length bias was by far the strongest trend and was evident in all datasets regardless of the expression profiling technology. The effect was due to differences between lesional and uninvolved skin with respect to the genome-wide correlation between gene length and gene expression, which was consistently more negative in psoriasis lesions. These findings demonstrate the complementary nature of {RNA-seq} and microarray technology and show that integrative analysis of both data types can provide a richer view of the transcriptome than strict reliance on a single method alone. Our results also highlight factors affecting correspondence between technologies, and we have established that gene length is a major determinant of differential expression in psoriasis lesions.},

  abstract={The {ENCODE} Project has generated a wealth of experimental information mapping diverse chromatin properties in several human cell lines. Although each such data track is independently informative toward the annotation of regulatory elements, their interrelations contain much richer information for the systematic annotation of regulatory elements. To uncover these interrelations and to generate an interpretable summary of the massive datasets of the {ENCODE} Project, we apply unsupervised learning methodologies, converting dozens of chromatin datasets into discrete annotation maps of regulatory regions and other chromatin elements across the human genome. These methods rediscover and summarize diverse aspects of chromatin architecture, elucidate the interplay between chromatin activity and {RNA} transcription, and reveal that a large proportion of the genome lies in a quiescent state, even across multiple cell types. The resulting annotation of non-coding regulatory elements correlate strongly with mammalian evolutionary constraint, and provide an unbiased approach for evaluating metrics of evolutionary constraint in human. Lastly, we use the regulatory annotations to revisit previously uncharacterized disease-associated loci, resulting in focused, testable hypotheses through the lens of the chromatin landscape.},

The purpose for this review is to provide an up-to-date synopsis of recent progress in ten sections exploring the immunological and inflammatory basis for psoriasis. Given the breadth of this topic in investigative skin biology and frequent paradigm shifts, it should not be surprising that the bibliography contains more than 150 references; many of which have been published in the last 5 years. Whereas considerable progress has been made into the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis, many fundamentally important questions remain regarding the role of cells located in both epidermal and dermal compartments. Attempts to characterize various animal models of psoriasis, delineation of the mechanism of action for biological agents, and consideration of molecular links between skin inflammation and various extracutaneous comorbidities are likely to continue challenging investigators and clinicians for many years to come.},

  abstract={Psoriasis is a common chronic autoimmune condition of the skin characterized by hyperplasia of epidermal keratinocytes associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. {IL-33} is a new member of the {IL-1} superfamily that signals through the {ST2} receptor and was originally defined as an inducer of T helper 2 {(Th2)} cytokines. Recently, broader immune activatory potential has been defined for {IL-33} particularly via mast cell activation and neutrophil migration. Here, we show that {ST2(-/-)} mice exhibit reduced cutaneous inflammatory responses compared with {WT} mice in a phorbol ester-induced model of skin inflammation. Furthermore, injections of {IL-33} into the ears of mice induce an inflammatory skin lesion. This inflammatory response was partially dependent on mast cells as mast cell-deficient mice {(Kit(W-sh/W-sh)} ) showed delayed responses to {IL-33.} {IL-33} also recruited neutrophils to the ear, an effect mediated in part by increased production of the chemokine {KC} {(CXCL1).} Finally, we show that {IL-33} expression is up-regulated in the epidermis of clinical psoriatic lesions, compared with healthy skin. These results therefore demonstrate that {IL-33} may play a role in psoriasis-like plaque inflammation. {IL-33} targeting may provide a new treatment strategy for psoriasis.},

  abstract={The peptide substance P {(SP)} has been implicated in inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis, where mast cells and {VEGF} are increased. A relationship between {SP} and {VEGF} has not been well studied, nor has any interaction with the proinflammatory cytokines, especially {IL-33.} Here we report that {SP} (0.1-10 {microM)} induces gene expression and secretion of {VEGF} from human {LAD2} mast cells and human umbilical core blood-derived cultured mast cells {(hCBMCs).} This effect is significantly increased by coadministration of {IL-33} (5-100 {ng/mL)} in both cell types. The effect of {SP} on {VEGF} release is inhibited by treatment with the {NK-1} receptor antagonist 733,060. {SP} rapidly increases cytosolic calcium, and so does {IL-33} to a smaller extent; the addition of {IL-33} augments the calcium increase. {SP-induced} {VEGF} production involves calcium-dependent {PKC} isoforms, as well as the {ERK} and {JNK} {MAPKs.} Gene expression of {IL-33} and histidine decarboxylase {(HDC),} an indicator of mast cell presence/activation, is significantly increased in affected and unaffected (at least 15 cm away from the lesion) psoriatic skin, as compared with normal control skin. Immunohistochemistry indicates that {IL-33} is associated with endothelial cells in both the unaffected and affected sites, but is stronger and also associated with immune cells in the affected site. These results imply that functional interactions among {SP,} {IL-33,} and mast cells leading to {VEGF} release contribute to inflammatory conditions, such as the psoriasis, a nonallergic hyperproliferative skin inflammatory disorder with a neurogenic component.},

  abstract={To gain further insight into the genetic architecture of psoriasis, we conducted a meta-analysis of 3 genome-wide association studies {(GWAS)} and 2 independent data sets genotyped on the Immunochip, including 10,588 cases and 22,806 controls. We identified 15 new susceptibility loci, increasing to 36 the number associated with psoriasis in European individuals. We also identified, using conditional analyses, five independent signals within previously known loci. The newly identified loci shared with other autoimmune diseases include candidate genes with roles in regulating T-cell function (such as {RUNX3,} {TAGAP} and {STAT3).} Notably, they included candidate genes whose products are involved in innate host defense, including interferon-mediated antiviral responses {(DDX58),} macrophage activation {(ZC3H12C)} and nuclear factor {(NF)-kappaB} signaling {(CARD14} and {CARM1).} These results portend a better understanding of shared and distinctive genetic determinants of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders and emphasize the importance of the skin in innate and acquired host defense.},

  abstract={The worldwide incidence and prevalence of psoriasis is poorly understood. To better understand this, we performed a systematic review of published population-based studies on the incidence and prevalence of psoriasis. Three electronic databases were searched from their inception dates to July 2011. A total of 385 papers were critically appraised; 53 studies reported on the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis in the general population. The prevalence in children ranged from 0\% {(Taiwan)} to 2.1\% {(Italy),} and in adults it varied from 0.91\% {(United} States) to 8.5\% {(Norway).} In children, the incidence estimate reported {(United} States) was 40.8/100,000 person-years. In adults, it varied from 78.9/100,000 person-years {(United} States) to 230/100,000 person-years {(Italy).} The data indicated that the occurrence of psoriasis varied according to age and geographic region, being more frequent in countries more distant from the equator. Prevalence estimates also varied in relation to demographic characteristics in that studies confined to adults reported higher estimates of psoriasis compared with those involving all age groups. Studies on the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis have contributed to a better understanding of the burden of the disease. However, further research is required to fill existing gaps in understanding the epidemiology of psoriasis and trends in incidence over time.},

  abstract={Graves disease {(GD)} is an autoimmune condition caused by interacting genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have mapped several single-nucleotide polymorphisms {(SNPs)} that are strongly associated with {GD,} but the mechanisms by which they trigger disease are unknown. We hypothesized that epigenetic modifications induced by microenvironmental influences of cytokines can reveal the functionality of {GD-associated} {SNPs.} We analyzed genome-wide histone H3 lysine 4 methylation and gene expression in thyroid cells induced by {IFNalpha,} a key cytokine secreted during viral infections, and overlapped them with known {GD-associated} {SNPs.} We mapped an open chromatin region overlapping two adjacent {GD-associated} {SNPs} (rs12101255 and rs12101261) in intron 1 of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor {(TSHR)} gene. We then demonstrated that this region functions as a regulatory element through binding of the transcriptional repressor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein {(PLZF)} at the rs12101261 site. Repression by {PLZF} depended on the rs12101261 disease susceptibility allele and was increased by {IFNalpha.} Intrathymic {TSHR} expression was decreased in individuals homozygous for the rs12101261 disease-associated genotype compared with carriers of the disease-protective allele. Our studies discovered a genetic-epigenetic interaction involving a noncoding {SNP} in the {TSHR} gene that regulates thymic {TSHR} gene expression and facilitates escape of {TSHR-reactive} T cells from central tolerance, triggering {GD.}},

  abstract={Psoriasis, an immune-mediated, inflammatory disease of the skin and joints, provides an ideal system for expression quantitative trait locus {(eQTL)} analysis, because it has a strong genetic basis and disease-relevant tissue (skin) is readily accessible. To better understand the role of genetic variants regulating cutaneous gene expression, we identified 841 cis-acting {eQTLs} using {RNA} extracted from skin biopsies of 53 psoriatic individuals and 57 healthy controls. We found substantial overlap between {cis-eQTLs} of normal control, uninvolved psoriatic, and lesional psoriatic skin. Consistent with recent studies and with the idea that control of gene expression can mediate relationships between genetic variants and disease risk, we found that {eQTL} {SNPs} are more likely to be associated with psoriasis than are randomly selected {SNPs.} To explore the tissue specificity of these {eQTLs} and hence to quantify the benefits of studying {eQTLs} in different tissues, we developed a refined statistical method for estimating {eQTL} overlap and used it to compare skin {eQTLs} to a published panel of lymphoblastoid cell line {(LCL)} {eQTLs.} Our method accounts for the fact that most {eQTL} studies are likely to miss some true {eQTLs} as a result of power limitations and shows that \{\textless\}70\% of {cis-eQTLs} in {LCLs} are shared with skin, as compared with the naive estimate of \{\textless\} 50\% sharing. Our results provide a useful method for estimating the overlap between various {eQTL} studies and provide a catalog of {cis-eQTLs} in skin that can facilitate efforts to understand the functional impact of identified susceptibility variants on psoriasis and other skin traits.},

  abstract={{BACKGROUND:} Rac3 is a small {GTPase} multifunctional protein that regulates cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. It has been considered as an oncogene in breast cancer; however, its role in esophageal cancer and the regulation of its stability have not been studied. F-box proteins are major subunits within the {Skp1-Cullin-1-F-box} {(SCF)} E3 ubiquitin ligases that recognize particular substrates for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Recently, we have shown that {SCFFBXL19} targets Rac1 and {RhoA,} thus regulating Rac1 and {RhoA} ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we demonstrate the role of {FBXL19} in the regulation of Rac3 site-specific ubiquitination and stability. Expression of {TGFbeta1} is associated with poor prognosis of esophageal cancer. {TGFbeta1} reduces tumor suppressor, E-cadherin, expression in various epithelial-derived cancers. Here we investigate the role of {FBXL19-mediated} Rac3 degradation in {TGFbeta1-induced} E-cadherin down-regulation in esophageal cancer cells. {METHODS:} {FBXL19-regulated} endogenous and over-expressed Rac3 stability were determined by immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation. Esophageal cancer cells {(OE19} and {OE33)} were used to investigate {TGFbeta1-induced} E-cadherin down-regulation by Immunoblotting and Immunostaining. {RESULTS:} Overexpression of {FBXL19} decreased endogenous and over-expressed Rac3 expression by interacting and polyubiquitinating Rac3, while down-regulation of {FBXL19} suppressed Rac3 degradation. Lysine166 within Rac3 was identified as an ubiquitination acceptor site. The {FBXL19} variant with truncation at the N-terminus resulted in an increase in Rac3 degradation; however, the {FBXL19} variant with truncation at the C-terminus lost its ability to interact with Rac3 and ubiquitinate Rac3 protein. Further, we found that Rac3 plays a critical role in {TGFbeta1-induced} E-cadherin down-regulation in esophageal cancer cells. Over-expression of {FBXL19} attenuated {TGFbeta1-induced} E-cadherin down-regulation and esophageal cancer cells elongation phenotype. {CONCLUSIONS:} Collectively these data unveil that {FBXL19} functions as an antagonist of Rac3 by regulating its stability and regulates the {TGFbeta1-induced} E-cadherin down-regulation. This study will provide a new potential therapeutic strategy to regulate {TGFbeta1} signaling, thus suppressing esophageal tumorigenesis.},

  abstract={Significance: The epidermal barrier prevents water loss and serves as the body's first line of defense against toxins, chemicals, and infectious microbes. Disruption of the barrier, either through congenital disorders of barrier formation or through wounds, puts the individual at risk for dehydration, hypersensitivity, infection, and prolonged inflammation. Epidermal barrier disorders affect millions of patients in the United States, causing loss of productivity and diminished quality of life for patients and their families, and represent a burden to the health-care system and society. Recent Advances: The genetic basis of many congenital barrier disorders has been identified in recent years, and great advances have been made in the molecular mechanisms of the formation and homeostasis of epidermal barrier, as well as acute and chronic wound healing. Progress in stem cell {(SC)} biology, particularly in induced pluripotent stem cells {(iPSCs)} and allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells {(MSCs),} has opened new doors for cell-based therapy of chronic wounds. Critical Issues: Understanding of the molecular mechanisms of barrier homeostasis in health and disease, as well as contributions of {iPSCs} and allogeneic {MSCs} to wound healing, will lead to the identification of novel targets for developing therapeutics for congenital barrier and wound healing disorders. Future Directions: Future studies should focus on better understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to disrupted homeostasis of epidermal barrier to identify potential therapeutic targets to combat its associated diseases.},

  abstract={{CTCF} is a highly conserved zinc finger protein implicated in diverse regulatory functions, including transcriptional activation/repression, insulation, imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation. Here we re-evaluate data supporting these roles in the context of mechanistic insights provided by recent genome-wide studies and highlight evidence for {CTCF-mediated} intra- and interchromosomal contacts at several developmentally regulated genomic loci. These analyses support a primary role for {CTCF} in the global organization of chromatin architecture and suggest that {CTCF} may be a heritable component of an epigenetic system regulating the interplay between {DNA} methylation, higher-order chromatin structure, and lineage-specific gene expression.},

  abstract={Psoriasis {(PS)} and Crohn disease {(CD)} have been shown to be epidemiologically, pathologically, and therapeutically connected, but little is known about their shared genetic causes. We performed meta-analyses of five published genome-wide association studies on {PS} (2,529 cases and 4,955 controls) and {CD} (2,142 cases and 5,505 controls), followed up 20 loci that showed strongest evidence for shared disease association and, furthermore, tested cross-disease associations for previously reported {PS} and {CD} risk alleles in additional 6,115 {PS} cases, 4,073 {CD} cases, and 10,100 controls. We identified seven susceptibility loci outside the human leukocyte antigen region (9p24 near {JAK2,} 10q22 at {ZMIZ1,} 11q13 near {PRDX5,} 16p13 near {SOCS1,} 17q21 at {STAT3,} 19p13 near {FUT2,} and 22q11 at {YDJC)} shared between {PS} and {CD} with genome-wide significance (p \{\textless\} 5 {\texttimes} 10 8) and confirmed four already established {PS} and {CD} risk loci {(IL23R,} {IL12B,} {REL,} and {TYK2).} Three of the shared loci are also genome-wide significantly associated with {PS} alone (10q22 at {ZMIZ1,} prs1250544 = 3.53 {\texttimes} 10 8, 11q13 near {PRDX5,} prs694739 = 3.71 {\texttimes} 10 09, 22q11 at {YDJC,} prs181359 = 8.02 {\texttimes} 10 10). In addition, we identified one susceptibility locus for {CD} (16p13 near {SOCS1,} prs4780355 = 4.99 {\texttimes} 10 8). Refinement of association signals identified shared genome-wide significant associations for exonic {SNPs} at 10q22 {(ZMIZ1)} and in silico expression quantitative trait locus analyses revealed that the associations at {ZMIZ1} and near {SOCS1} have a potential functional effect on gene expression. Our results show the usefulness of joint analyses of clinically distinct immune-mediated diseases and enlarge the map of shared genetic risk loci.},

  abstract={The precise regulation of gene transcription during metazoan development is controlled by a complex system of interactions between transcription factors, histone modifications and modifying enzymes and chromatin conformation. Developments in chromosome conformation capture technologies have revealed that interactions between regions of chromatin are pervasive and highly cell-type specific. The movement of enhancers and promoters in and out of higher-order chromatin structures within the nucleus are associated with changes in expression and histone modifications. However, the factors responsible for mediating these changes and determining enhancer:promoter specificity are still not completely known. In this review, we summarize what is known about the patterns of epigenetic and chromatin features characteristic of elements involved in long-range interactions. In addition, we review the insights into both local and global patterns of chromatin interactions that have been revealed by the latest experimental and computational methods.},

  abstract={{RhoA} is a small {GTPase} multifunctional protein that regulates cell proliferation and cytoskeletal reorganization. Regulation of its protein stability plays an important role in its biological functions. We have shown that a {Skp1-Cul1-F-box} {(SCF)} {FBXL19} E3 ubiquitin ligase targets Rac1, a related member of the Rho family for ubiquitination and degradation. Here, {SCF(FBXL19)} mediates {RhoA} ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in lung epithelial cells. Ectopically expressed {FBXL19} decreased {RhoA} wild type, active, and inactive forms. Cellular depletion of {FBXL19} increased {RhoA} protein levels and extended its half-life. {FBXL19} bound the small {GTPase} in the cytoplasm leading to {RhoA} ubiquitination at Lys(135). A {RhoA(K135R)} mutant protein was resistant to {SCF(FBXL19)-mediated} ubiquitination and degradation and exhibited a longer lifespan. Protein kinase Erk2-mediated phosphorylation of {RhoA} was both sufficient and required for {SCF(FBXL19)-mediated} {RhoA} ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, {SCF(FBXL19)} targets {RhoA} for its disposal, a process regulated by Erk2. Ectopically expressed {FBXL19} reduced phosphorylation of p27 and cell proliferation, a process mediated by {RhoA.} Further, {FBXL19} cellular expression diminished lysophosphatidic acid {(LPA)-induced} phosphorylation of myosin light chain {(MLC)} and stress fiber formation. Hence, {SCF(FBXL19)} functions as a {RhoA} antagonist during cell proliferation and cytoskeleton rearrangement. These results provide the first evidence of an F-box protein targeting {RhoA} thereby modulating its cellular lifespan that impacts cell proliferation and cytoskeleton rearrangement.},

Nucleosomes package {DNA} into a dynamic chromatin structure, and by assuming defined positions in chromatin, influence gene regulation. Nucleosomes can serve as repressors, presumably by blocking access to regulatory elements; consequently, the positions of nucleosomes relative to the location of cis-acting elements are critical. Some genes have a chromatin structure that is “preset,” ready for activation, while others require “remodeling” for activation. Nucleosome positioning may be determined by multiple factors, including {histone–DNA} interactions, boundaries defined by {DNA} structure or protein binding, and higher-order chromatin structure. {\textcopyright} 1994 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc.},

  abstract={A nucleosomal array consists of core histone {octamer-DNA} complexes spaced at approximately 200 bp intervals along a {DNA} molecule. Nucleosomal arrays are the fundamental building block of chromosomal superstructures, the substrate for transcription, and the first nucleoprotein assembly laid down after {DNA} replication. The development of homogeneous length-defined nucleosomal arrays has led to a greatly improved understanding of nucleosomal array structural dynamics in the solution state. Under physiological salt conditions, a nucleosomal array is in dynamic equilibrium between folded, self-associated and dissociated conformational states. Folding and self-association are both critically dependent on the core histone tail domains, consistent with an essential functional role for the tail domains in the mediation of chromosomal level {DNA} compaction in the nucleus. Nucleosomal array folding is repressive in transcription in vitro, but can be overcome by compositional (e.g., tail domain acetylation) and configurational (e.g., histone octamer depletion) changes that are correlated with transcriptional activation in vivo. The mechanism of replication-coupled chromatin assembly also appears to be functionally linked to the dynamic properties of nucleosomal arrays. Although once thought to be both structurally and functionally inert, it is now apparent that the nucleosomal array is a key participant in the biological processes that take place within the chromosomal fibers of eukaryotes.},

However, the phenotype of the pathogenic lymphocyte and nature of the T cell activating event which triggers conversion of symptomless {(PN)} skin into psoriatic plaques {(PP} skin) is unknown. This study extends our previous observations in which autologous blood-derived immunocytes were injected into {PN} skin engrafted onto {SCID} mice to produce full-fledged {PP} lesions. The first question addressed is whether injected {CD4+} T cells or {CD8+} T cells were responsible for phenotypic conversion of {PN} to {PP} skin. In five different patients only {CD4+} but not {CD8+} T cell lines produced psoriatic lesions. Next, immunological events occurring within {PN} skin following injection of {CD4+} T cells in grafts that had sufficient tissue available for detailed analysis was examined. In two patients, intraepidermal resident {CD8+} T cells were induced to proliferate during lesion development, expressing acute activation markers {CD25} and {CD69.} In another patient, injection of {CD4+} T cells revealed {CD69} expression by intraepidermal {CD4+} as well as {CD8+} T cells. To explore the molecular basis for local T cell activation and proliferation, we discovered that intraepidermal immunocytes, including both {CD4} and {CD8+} T cells, expressed surface receptors (ie, {CD94,} {CD158a,} {CD158b)} typically confined to natural killer cells (ie, natural killer receptors; {NKRs)} accumulated immediately before onset of acute lesions. The presence of {NKR} bearing immunocytes was also observed in 10 of 15 different biopsies of chronic plaques taken directly from patients, whereas {PN} skin (n = 8) or normal skin from healthy donors (n = 8), did not contain such {NKR} positive immunocytes. Of particular relevance to psoriasis is that these {NKRs} recognize various class I alleles including those typically inherited by psoriatic family members such as {HLA-C} and {HLA-B} allotypes. We conclude that injection of {CD4+} T cells into {PN} skin triggers a series of local immunologically mediated stimulatory events that produce further T cell activation and appearance of both {CD4} and {CD8+} T cells that express {NKRs.}},

The higher order functional information is stored in the {PATHWAY} database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The {PATHWAY} database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in {KEGG} is {LIGAND} for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. {KEGG} provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

The frequency of {CLA+D8+} T cells correlated more strongly with redness, thickness and scaling of the skin lesions than the total affected body surface area. In contrast to {CLA} the T cell expression of {VLA-4} did not demonstrate any such correlation. Finally, the expression of the activation marker {CD25} on {CD8+} T cells showed a strong correlation with disease severity in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis {(PASI} \{\textgreater\} 10) but such correlation was not observed for {CD4+} T cells.

In the present article, we describe {UGRP1} (encoding uteroglobin-related protein 1) as one of asthma-susceptibility genes that is located on chromosome 5q31-q32. {UGRP1} is a homodimeric secretory protein of 17 {kDa} and is expressed only in lung and trachea. The G --\&gt; A polymorphism was identified at -112 bp in the human {UGRP1} gene promoter. The {-112A} allele is responsible for a 24\% reduction in the promoter activity in relation to the {-112G} allele, as examined by transfection analysis. Electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis revealed that an unknown nuclear factor binds to the region around -112 bp. The binding affinity with the {-112A} oligonucleotide was reduced by approximately one half, as compared with the {-112G} oligonucleotide. In a case-control study using 169 Japanese individuals (84 patients with asthma and 85 healthy control individuals), those with a {-112A} allele {(G/A} or {A/A)} were 4.1 times more likely to have asthma than were those with the wild-type allele {(G/G).}},

Compact and open chromatin fiber structures were separated by sucrose sedimentation and their distributions analyzed by hybridization to metaphase chromosomes and genomic microarrays. We show that compact chromatin fibers originate from some sites of heterochromatin {(C-bands),} and G-bands (euchromatin). Open chromatin fibers correlate with regions of highest gene density, but not with gene expression since inactive genes can be in domains of open chromatin, and active genes in regions of low gene density can be embedded in compact chromatin fibers. Moreover, we show that chromatin fiber structure impacts on further levels of chromatin condensation. Regions of open chromatin fibers are cytologically decondensed and have a distinctive nuclear organization. We suggest that domains of open chromatin may create an environment that facilitates transcriptional activation and could provide an evolutionary constraint to maintain clusters of genes together along chromosomes.},

  abstract={1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) {[1,25(OH)(2)D(3)]} regulates mineral homeostasis and exhibits potent anti-proliferative, prodifferentiative, and immunomodulatory activities. It mediates these effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor {(VDR),} which belongs to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptors. As a result of keratinocyte differentiation and anti-proliferation activities, {1,25(OH)(2)D(3)} and its synthetic analogs are therapeutically effective in psoriasis and show promise for the treatment of actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma. To elucidate the {VDR} signaling pathway in keratinocytes, we examined the gene expression profile with {1,25(OH)(2)D(3)} treatment using oligonucleotide microarrays. Out of the 12,600 genes investigated, 82 were upregulated and 16 were downregulated and many of these were involved in differentiation, proliferation, and immune response. We have identified three vitamin D-responsive chromosomal loci (1p36, 19q13, and 6p25) and show the induction of various class {II} tumor suppressor/growth-regulatory genes in response to {1,25(OH)(2)D(3).} Finally, quantitative differences in gene expression revealed a vitamin D-regulated differentiation network and identified peptidylarginine deiminases, kallikreins, serine proteinase inhibitor family members, Kruppel-like factor 4, and c-fos as vitamin D-responsive genes, whose protein products may play an important role in epidermal differentiation in normal and diseased state.},

  abstract={{MicroRNAs} {(miRNAs)} are short non-coding {RNAs} that regulate gene expression in plants and animals. Although their biological importance has become clear, how they recognize and regulate target genes remains less well understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the minimal requirements for functional {miRNA-target} duplexes in vivo and distinguish classes of target sites with different functional properties. Target sites can be grouped into two broad categories. 5' dominant sites have sufficient complementarity to the {miRNA} 5' end to function with little or no support from pairing to the {miRNA} 3' end. Indeed, sites with 3' pairing below the random noise level are functional given a strong 5' end. In contrast, 3' compensatory sites have insufficient 5' pairing and require strong 3' pairing for function. We present examples and genome-wide statistical support to show that both classes of sites are used in biologically relevant genes. We provide evidence that an average {miRNA} has approximately 100 target sites, indicating that {miRNAs} regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes and that {miRNA} 3' ends are key determinants of target specificity within {miRNA} families.},

Furthermore, {IFN-α} reconstitution experiments demonstrated that {PDC-derived} {IFN-α} is essential to drive the development of psoriasis in vivo.

  abstract={Most common diseases and most quantitative traits that can be measured in human populations are complex genetic traits. That is, many genetic and nongenetic factors interact to determine the final phenotype, whether that phenotype is susceptibility to disease, or a quantifiable trait such as height, weight, serum cholesterol, or blood pressure. Identifying the genes that underlie the population variation in these phenotypes has been challenging. Recently, databases of common genetic variants, recognition of the patterns of genetic variation, and rapid genotyping methodologies have emerged, and the combination of these tools and resources will greatly facilitate genetic association studies, a potentially powerful method to map the genes for complex traits. However, care will be required in performing and interpreting these association studies. Until genome-wide studies are feasible, choosing candidate genes will be necessary. In addition, the choice of phenotype will likely influence the success of these gene mapping efforts. Finally, population genetic methods, including searching for genes under selection, may provide clues to the location of the genes for common disease and complex traits.},

  abstract={Psoriasis is a common skin disease, the pathogenesis of which has not yet been resolved. In mice, epidermis-specific deletion of inhibitor of {NF-κB} {(IκB)} kinase 2 {(IKK2)} results in a skin phenotype that mimics human psoriasis in several aspects. Like psoriasis, this skin disease shows pronounced improvement when mice are treated with a {TNF-neutralizing} agent. We have found previously that this phenotype does not depend on the presence of αβ T lymphocytes. In order to evaluate contributions of other immune cell populations to the skin disease, we selectively eliminated macrophages and granulocytes from the skin of mice with epidermis-specific deletion of {IKK2} {(K14-Cre-IKK2fl/fl} mice). Elimination of skin macrophages by subcutaneous injection of clodronate liposomes was accompanied by inhibition of granulocyte migration into the skin and resulted in a dramatic attenuation of psoriasis-like skin changes. The hyperproliferative, inflammatory skin disease in {K14-Cre-IKK2fl/fl} mice was a direct consequence of the presence of macrophages in the skin, as targeted deletion of {CD18,} which prevented accumulation of granulocytes but not macrophages, did not lead to major changes in the phenotype. Targeted deletion of the receptor for {IFN-γ} revealed that the pathogenesis of the skin disease does not depend on classical {IFN-γ–mediated} macrophage activation. Our results demonstrate that in mice epidermal keratinocytes can initiate a hyperproliferative, inflammatory, {IFN-γ–independent,} psoriasis-like skin disease whose development requires essential contributions from skin macrophages but not from granulocytes or αβ T lymphocytes.},

We evaluated a variety of cryopreservation strategies with the aim of developing an optimized protocol for freezing and thawing {PBMC} to retain viability and function. We determined several factors which do not affect cell viability after cryopreservation such as shipping frozen samples on dry ice, the length of time and speed at which samples are washed and centrifuged after thawing, and the number of cells frozen per container. Different media additives, however, did impact the viability of the cells after thawing. There was a significant reduction in the viability of the cells after freezing when using human {AB} serum compared to all other additives tested (p\{\textless\}0.000). A second critical parameter was the temperature of the media used to wash the cells after removal from the cryotubes. When the media was cooled to 4 {{\textdegree}C} prior to washing, the mean viability was 69.7{\textpm}12.5\%, at 25 {{\textdegree}C} 92.55{\textpm}3.1\%, and at 37 {{\textdegree}C} 95.11{\textpm}2.5\%.

  abstract={Dendritic cells {(DCs)} comprise heterogeneous subsets of professional antigen-presenting cells, linking innate and adaptive immunity. Analysis of {DC} subsets has been hampered by a lack of specific {DC} markers and reliable quantitation assays. We characterised the immunophenotype and functional characteristics of psoriatic arthritis {(PsA)-derived} and rheumatoid arthritis {(RA)-derived} myeloid {DCs} {(mDCs)} and plasmacytoid {DCs} {(pDCs)} to evaluate their potential role in arthritis. Circulating peripheral blood {(PB)} {pDC} numbers were significantly reduced in {PsA} patients {(P} = 0.0098) and {RA} patients {(P} = 0.0194), and {mDCs} were significantly reduced in {RA} patients {(P} = 0.0086) compared with healthy controls. The number of circulating {mDCs} in {RA} {PB} was significantly inversely correlated to C-reactive protein {(P} = 0.021). The phenotype of both {DC} subsets in {PsA} {PB} and {RA} {PB} was immature as compared with healthy controls. Moreover, {CD62L} expression was significantly decreased on both {mDCs} {(PsA,} P = 0.0122; {RA,} P = 0.0371) and {pDCs} {(PsA,} P = 0.0373; {RA,} P = 0.0367) in {PB.} Both {mDCs} and {pDCs} were present in {PsA} synovial fluid {(SF)} and {RA} {SF,} with the {mDC:pDC} ratio significantly exceeding that in matched {PB} {(PsA} {SF,} P = 0.0453; {RA} {SF,} P = 0.0082). {pDCs} isolated from {RA} {SF} and {PsA} {SF} displayed an immature phenotype comparable with {PB} {pDCs.} {RA} and {PsA} {SF} {mDCs,} however, displayed a more mature phenotype (increased expression of {CD80,} {CD83} and {CD86)} compared with {PB} {mDCs.} Functional analysis revealed that both {SF} {DC} subsets matured following toll-like receptor stimulation. {pDCs} from {PB} and {SF} produced interferon alpha and tumour necrosis factor alpha on {TLR9} stimulation, but only {SF} {pDCs} produced {IL-10.} Similarly, {mDCs} from {PB} and {SF} produced similar tumour necrosis factor alpha levels to {TLR2} agonism, whereas {SF} {mDCs} produced more {IL-10} than {PB} controls. Circulating {DC} subset numbers are reduced in {RA} {PB} and {PsA} {PB} with reduced {CD62L} expression. Maturation is incomplete in the inflamed synovial compartment. Immature {DCs} in {SF} may contribute to the perpetuation of inflammation via sampling of the inflamed synovial environment, and in situ presentation of arthritogenic antigen.},

The procedure was well tolerated with any discomfort described as mild; we did not observe any cases of Koebner phenomena at any non-lesional tape-stripped sites. Tape-harvested epidermis was extracted for {RNA,} which was profiled by semiquantitative reverse {transcriptase-PCR.} This analysis revealed that {mRNAs} for tumor necrosis factor alpha, {IFNgamma,} Krt-16, {CD2,} {IL-23A,} {IL-12B,} and vascular endothelial growth factor are overexpressed in the "average" psoriatic lesion in a majority of patients. In addition, 10 of these patients were biopsied at lesional and non-lesional sites and the expression data compared to tape-stripping data. This comparison shows that five of seven {mRNA} are more highly expressed in cells captured by tape stripping than biopsy, suggesting that the upper aspect of a lesion contains cells very active in the disease. The tape-harvesting data reveal that approximately 46\% of lesions have at least one pathogenic {mRNA} within non-lesional skin limits. Data demonstrate that tape stripping reveals {mRNA} markers not detected in biopsy samples and thus the method may be a useful supplement to biopsy.},

Previously we found that this chronic psoriasiform skin inflammation also depends on the presence of {CD4+} T cells. Herein we investigated the role of macrophages in this {CD18hypo} mouse model. Activated macrophages were significantly increased in lesional skin as well as in inflamed skin draining lymph nodes {(DLNs)} of affected {CD18hypo} mice and were identified as being an important source of {TNF-α} in vivo. Both depletion of macrophages and neutralization of {TNF-α} resulted in a significant alleviation of psoriasiform skin inflammation. As monocyte chemotactic protein 1 was enhanced in lesional skin of affected {CD18hypo} mice, we intradermally injected recombinant murine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 {(rJE/MCP-1)} alone or in combination with {rTNF-α} into the skin of healthy {CD18hypo} mice. Only simultaneous injection of {rJE/MCP-1} and {rTNF-α,} but neither substance alone, resulted in the induction of psoriasiform skin inflammation around the injection sites with recruitment and activation of macrophages. Collectively, our data suggest that maintenance of psoriasiform skin inflammation critically depends on efficient recruitment and activation of macrophages with sufficient release of {TNF-α.}},

  abstract={Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disorder that is inherited as a multifactorial trait. Genetic analyses have repeatedly identified a primary disease susceptibility locus lying within the major histocompatibility complex {(MHC),} on chromosome 6p21. A small number of {non-MHC} susceptibility loci have also been identified. These regions tend to overlap with susceptibility intervals for Crohn's disease and atopic dermatitis, suggesting the possibility that genetic variants affecting inflammatory pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple disorders. Here, we report a genetic analysis of the interleukin 23 receptor gene {(IL23R),} which was recently identified as a susceptibility determinant for Crohn's disease. We initially examined the results of a whole-genome association scan, carried out on 318 cases and 288 controls. We observed a significant increase of a non-synonymous substitution {(p.Arg381Gln)} among controls {(P} = 0.00036). We validated this finding by extending our cohort to include a further 519 cases and 528 controls. In the overall sample, the frequency of the {381Gln} allele was 3.6\% in cases and 7\% in controls, yielding a P value of 0.00014. Next, we examined genetic variation at the {IL12RB1,} {IL23A} and {IL12B} genes, respectively, encoding the second subunit of the {IL23R} receptor and the two subunits of its ligand. This analysis identified independent associations for {IL12B} {SNPs} rs10045431 {(P} value for the extended dataset = 0.0001) and rs3212227 {(P} = 0.036). Altogether, these findings indicate that genes participating in {IL23} signalling play a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic epithelial inflammation.},

  abstract={Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory joint disease that is heterogeneous in presentation and clinical course. Evidence that this disease is distinct from rheumatoid arthritis and other spondyloarthropathies is based on data derived from characteristic clinical features, histopathologic analyses, immunogenetic associations and musculoskeletal imaging. Emphasis has centered previously on a dominant role for the T lymphocyte in the inflammatory process; however, studies provide support for a major contribution from monocyte-macrophages in the initiation and perpetuation of joint and skin inflammation. The occurrence of arthritis in the absence of psoriasis in a minority of patients with psoriatic arthritis, coupled with divergent genetic risk factors, indicates that psoriatic arthritis is distinct from psoriatic skin inflammation. A new terminology, psoriatic disease, has emerged that encompasses the various manifestations of tissue and organ involvement observed in many psoriasis patients, including inflammation in the joint, eye and gut. Moreover, adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes in patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis might be directly linked to the cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations of these diseases via subsets of circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages activated by inflammatory cytokine networks that arise in the skin and possibly the joint.},

  abstract={{MicroRNAs} are a recently discovered class of posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression with critical functions in health and disease. Psoriasis is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease in adults, with a substantial negative impact on the patients' quality of life. Here we show for the first time that psoriasis-affected skin has a specific {microRNA} expression profile when compared with healthy human skin or with another chronic inflammatory skin disease, atopic eczema. Among the psoriasis-specific {microRNAs,} we identified leukocyte-derived {microRNAs} and one keratinocyte-derived {microRNA,} {miR-203.} In a panel of 21 different human organs and tissues, {miR-203} showed a highly skin-specific expression profile. Among the cellular constituents of the skin, it was exclusively expressed by keratinocytes. The up-regulation of {miR-203} in psoriatic plaques was concurrent with the down-regulation of an evolutionary conserved target of {miR-203,} suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 {(SOCS-3),} which is involved in inflammatory responses and keratinocyte functions. Our results suggest that {microRNA} deregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and contributes to the dysfunction of the cross talk between resident and infiltrating cells. Taken together, a new layer of regulatory mechanisms is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases.},

  abstract={We previously discovered that mutations of the human {FOXP2} gene cause a monogenic communication disorder, primarily characterized by difficulties in learning to make coordinated sequences of articulatory gestures that underlie speech. Affected people have deficits in expressive and receptive linguistic processing and display structural and/or functional abnormalities in cortical and subcortical brain regions. {FOXP2} provides a unique window into neural processes involved in speech and language. In particular, its role as a transcription factor gene offers powerful functional genomic routes for dissecting critical neurogenetic mechanisms. Here, we employ chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with promoter microarrays {(ChIP-chip)} to successfully identify genomic sites that are directly bound by {FOXP2} protein in native chromatin of human neuron-like cells. We focus on a subset of downstream targets identified by this approach, showing that altered {FOXP2} levels yield significant changes in expression in our cell-based models and that {FOXP2} binds in a specific manner to consensus sites within the relevant promoters. Moreover, we demonstrate significant quantitative differences in target expression in embryonic brains of mutant mice, mediated by specific in vivo Foxp2-chromatin interactions. This work represents the first identification and in vivo verification of neural targets regulated by {FOXP2.} Our data indicate that {FOXP2} has dual functionality, acting to either repress or activate gene expression at occupied promoters. The identified targets suggest roles in modulating synaptic plasticity, neurodevelopment, neurotransmission, and axon guidance and represent novel entry points into in vivo pathways that may be disturbed in speech and language disorders.},

  abstract={Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disorder that is inherited as a multifactorial trait. Linkage studies have clearly identified a primary disease susceptibility locus lying within the major histocompatibility complex {(MHC),} but have generated conflicting results for other genomic regions. To overcome this difficulty, we have carried out a genome-wide association scan, where we analyzed more than 408,000 {SNPs} in an initial sample of 318 cases and 288 controls. Outside of the {MHC,} we observed a single cluster of disease-associated markers, spanning 47 kb on chromosome 20q13. The analysis of two replication data sets confirmed this association, with {SNP} rs495337 yielding a combined P-value of 1.4 x 10(-8) in an overall sample of 2679 cases and 2215 controls. Rs495337 maps to the {SPATA2} transcript and is in absolute linkage disequilibrium with five {SNPs} lying in the adjacent {ZNF313} gene (also known as {RNF114).} Real-time {PCR} experiments showed that, unlike {SPATA2,} {ZNF313} is abundantly expressed in skin, T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Furthermore, an analysis of the expression data available from the Genevar database indicated that rs495337 is associated with increased {ZNF313} transcripts levels {(P} = 0.003), suggesting that the disease susceptibility allele may be a {ZNF313} regulatory variant tagged by rs495337. Homology searches indicated that {ZNF313} is a paralogue of {TRAC-1,} an ubiquitin ligase regulating T-cell activation. We performed cell-free assays and confirmed that like {TRAC-1,} {ZNF313} binds ubiquitin via an ubiquitin-interaction motif {(UIM).} These findings collectively identify a novel psoriasis susceptibility gene, with a putative role in the regulation of immune responses.},

Ectopic expression of {miR-150} in breast cancer and leukemic cells repressed endogenous {c-Myb} at both messenger {RNA} {(mRNA)} and protein levels. Among several leukemia cell lines, primary leukemia cells, and normal lymphocytes, expression levels of {miR-150} inversely correlated with {c-Myb.} The {miR-150} overexpression or {c-Myb} silencing in zebrafish zygotes led to similar and serious phenotypic defects in zebrafish, and the phenotypic aberrations induced by {miR-150} could be reversed by coinjection of {c-Myb} {mRNA.} Our findings suggest that {c-Myb} is an evolutionally conserved target of {miR-150} and {miR-150/c-Myb} interaction is important for embryonic development and possibly oncogenesis.},

Replications were performed with an independent cohort of 577 {PS} cases and 737 controls from the {U.S.,} and 576 {PSA} patients and 480 controls from the {U.K..} Strongest associations were with the class I region of the major histocompatibility complex {(MHC).} The most highly associated {SNP} was rs10484554, which lies 34.7 kb upstream from {HLA-C} {(P = 7.8{\texttimes}10−11,} {GWA} scan; P = 1.8{\texttimes}10−30, replication; P = 1.8{\texttimes}10−39, combined; {U.K.} {PSA:} P = 6.9{\texttimes}10−11).

This variant is associated with low viral set point following {HIV} infection and its effect is independent of rs10484554. We replicated the previously reported association with interleukin 23 receptor and interleukin {12B} {(IL12B)} polymorphisms in {PS} and {PSA} cohorts {(IL23R:} rs11209026, {U.S.} {PS,} P = 1.4{\texttimes}10−4; {U.K.} {PSA:} P = 8.0{\texttimes}10−4; {IL12B:rs6887695,} {U.S.} {PS,} P = 5{\texttimes}10−5 and {U.K.} {PSA,} P = 1.3{\texttimes}10−3) and detected an independent association in the {IL23R} region with a {SNP} 4 kb upstream from {IL12RB2} {(P = 0.001).} Novel associations replicated in the {U.S.} {PS} cohort included the region harboring lipoma {HMGIC} fusion partner {(LHFP)} and conserved oligomeric golgi complex component 6 {(COG6)} genes on chromosome 13q13 (combined P = 2{\texttimes}10−6 for rs7993214; {OR = 0.71),} the late cornified envelope gene cluster {(LCE)} from the Epidermal Differentiation Complex {(PSORS4)} (combined P = 6.2{\texttimes}10−5 for rs6701216; {OR} 1.45) and a region of {LD} at 15q21 (combined P = 2.9{\texttimes}10−5 for rs3803369; {OR = 1.43).} This region is of interest because it harbors ubiquitin-specific protease-8 whose processed pseudogene lies upstream from {HLA-C.} This region of 15q21 also harbors the gene for {SPPL2A} (signal peptide peptidase like 2a) which activates tumor necrosis factor alpha by cleavage, triggering the expression of {IL12} in human dendritic cells.

People with psoriasis were identified from the computerized morbidity indices of 2 large {UK} general practices, total population 22,500. Questionnaires were mailed to all 633 patients thus identified. Of the respondents, a 50\% sample was assessed clinically and a proportion had blood samples and radiographs taken. Patients labeled as having psoriasis were also cross-referenced with a local secondary care morbidity index for {PsA} and rheumatoid arthritis. Figures for the prevalence of {PsA} were estimated from these data. One hundred sixty-eight questionnaires were returned (response rate 27\%) and 93 people (55\% of questionnaire respondents) were examined. Of these 93 people, 12 (4 of whom were cross-referenced to the hospital database) were thought to have {PsA} clinically, all fulfilling the {CASPAR} criteria for {PsA.} Six of the 93 examined patients did not have psoriasis or a family history of psoriasis and had no historical features or clinical signs of psoriasis on interview and examination. Extrapolating from the data of those people actually examined, the estimated (corrected) prevalence was 13.8\% (95\% confidence interval 7.1–24.1\%). The estimated prevalence of {PsA} in this population, using the {CASPAR} criteria, was 13.8\%.

However, the use of topical agents as monotherapy in the setting of extensive disease or in the setting of limited, but recalcitrant, disease is not routinely recommended. Treatment should be tailored to meet individual patients' needs. We will discuss the efficacy and safety of as well as offer recommendations for the use of topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, tazarotene, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, emollients, salicylic acid, anthralin, coal tar, as well as combination therapy.},

  abstract={Previous research into the molecular mechanisms that underlie Ag-specific {CD8(+)} T cell differentiation and function has largely focused on the role of proteins. However, it is now apparent that the mammalian genome expresses large numbers of long (\&gt;200 nt) nonprotein-coding {RNAs} {(ncRNAs),} and there is increasing evidence that these {RNAs} have important regulatory functions, particularly in the regulation of epigenetic processes underpinning cell differentiation. In this study, we show that {CD8(+)} T cells express hundreds of long {ncRNAs,} many of which are lymphoid-specific and/or change dynamically with lymphocyte differentiation or activation. Numerous {ncRNAs} surround or overlap immunologically important protein-coding genes and can be predicted to function via a range of regulatory mechanisms. The overlap of many long {ncRNAs} expressed in {CD8(+)} T cells with {microRNAs} and small interfering {RNAs} further suggests that long {ncRNAs} may be processed into and exert their effects via smaller functional species. Finally, we show that the majority of long {ncRNAs} expressed in {CD8(+)} T cells harbor signatures of evolutionary conservation, secondary structures, and/or regulated promoters, further supporting their functionality. Taken together, our findings represent the first systematic discovery of long {ncRNAs} expressed in {CD8(+)} T cells and suggest that many of these transcripts are likely to play a role in adaptive immunity.},

After sorting cells by {CD200,} {CD34,} and forward scatter {(FSC)} values (cell size), colony-forming assays were performed. We found that biomarkers were differentially expressed in the epidermis and {ORS.} Basal bulge cells were mainly {K15+CD200+CD34(-)CD271(-),} and suprabasal cells were {K15(-)CD200+CD34(-)CD271(-).} We categorized follicular cells into nine subpopulations according to biomarker expression profiles. The {CD200+CD34(-)} bulge cells had much higher colony-forming abilities than the {CD34+} population, and were divided into two subpopulations: a {CD200+CD34(-)FSC(high)} {(K15-rich,} basal) and a {CD200+CD34(-)FSC(low)} {(K15-poor,} suprabasal) population. The former formed fewer but larger-sized colonies than the latter. Follicular epithelial cell cultivation resulted in loss of K15, {CD200,} {CD34,} and {CD271} expression, but maintenance of K14, {CD29,} and {CD49f} expression.

Free primers are removed by exonuclease I and a {poly(A)} tail is added to the 3' end of the first-strand {cDNAs} by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Single-cell {cDNAs} are then amplified by 20 + 9 cycles of {PCR.} The resulting 100-200 ng of amplified {cDNAs} are used to construct a sequencing library, which can be used for deep sequencing using the {SOLiD} system.

Our characterization of the insertion site preferences of Hermes not only assists in the future use of this transposon as a molecular biology tool but also establishes methods to more fully determine targeting mechanisms of other transposons. We have also discovered a long-range sequence motif that defines S. cerevisiae nucleosome-free regions.},

  abstract={A plethora of epigenetic modifications have been described in the human genome and shown to play diverse roles in gene regulation, cellular differentiation and the onset of disease. Although individual modifications have been linked to the activity levels of various genetic functional elements, their combinatorial patterns are still unresolved and their potential for systematic de novo genome annotation remains untapped. Here, we use a multivariate Hidden Markov Model to reveal 'chromatin states' in human T cells, based on recurrent and spatially coherent combinations of chromatin marks. We define 51 distinct chromatin states, including promoter-associated, transcription-associated, active intergenic, large-scale repressed and repeat-associated states. Each chromatin state shows specific enrichments in functional annotations, sequence motifs and specific experimentally observed characteristics, suggesting distinct biological roles. This approach provides a complementary functional annotation of the human genome that reveals the genome-wide locations of diverse classes of epigenetic function.},

Expression of insulator {CCCTC} binding factor {(CTCF)} was found to be required for expression of all {MHC} class {II} genes associated with antigen presentation. Ten {CTCF} sites that divide the {MHC-II} locus into apparent evolutionary domains were identified. To define the role of {CTCF} in mediating regulation of the {MHC} {II} genes, chromatin conformation capture assays, which provide an architectural assessment of a locus, were conducted across the {MHC-II} region. Depending on whether {MHC-II} genes and the class {II} transactivator {(CIITA)} were being expressed, two {CTCF-dependent} chromatin architectural states, each with multiple configurations and interactions, were observed. These states included the ability to express {MHC-II} gene promoter regions to interact with nearby {CTCF} sites and {CTCF} sites to interact with each other. Thus, {CTCF} organizes the {MHC-II} locus into a novel basal architecture of interacting foci and loop structures that rearranges in the presence of {CIITA.} Disruption of the rearranged states eradicated expression, suggesting that the formation of these structures is key to coregulation of {MHC-II} genes and the locus.},

  abstract={To further elucidate molecular alterations in psoriasis, we performed a gene expression study of 58 paired lesional and uninvolved psoriatic and 64 control skin samples. Comparison of involved psoriatic {(PP)} and normal {(NN)} skin identified 1,326 differentially regulated transcripts encoding 918 unique genes (549 up- and 369 downregulated), of which over 600 are to our knowledge previously unreported, including {S100A7A,} {THRSP,} and {ELOVL3.} Strongly upregulated genes included {SERPINB4,} {PI3,} {DEFB4,} and several S100-family members. Strongly downregulated genes included Wnt-inhibitory factor-1 {(WIF1),} β-cellulin {(BTC),} and {CCL27.} Enriched gene ontology categories included immune response, defense response, and keratinocyte differentiation. Biological processes regulating fatty acid and lipid metabolism were enriched in the down-regulated gene set. Comparison of the psoriatic transcriptome to the transcriptomes of cytokine-stimulated cultured keratinocytes {(IL-17,} {IL-22,} {IL-1α,} {IFN-γ,} {TNF-α,} and {OSM)} showed surprisingly little overlap, with the cytokine-stimulated keratinocyte expression representing only 2.5, 0.7, 1.5, 5.6, 5.0, and 1.9\% of the lesional psoriatic dysregulated transcriptome, respectively.

Whether all {lncRNAs} described insofar are products of {RNA} genes, however, is still unclear. Here we have characterized transcription sites located outside protein-coding genes in a highly regulated response, macrophage activation by endotoxin. Using chromatin signatures, we could unambiguously classify extragenic {Pol\_II} binding sites as belonging to either canonical {RNA} genes or transcribed enhancers. Unexpectedly, 70\% of extragenic {Pol\_II} peaks were associated with genomic regions with a canonical chromatin signature of enhancers. Enhancer-associated extragenic transcription was frequently adjacent to inducible inflammatory genes, was regulated in response to endotoxin stimulation, and generated very low abundance transcripts. Moreover, transcribed enhancers were under purifying selection and contained binding sites for inflammatory transcription factors, thus suggesting their functionality. These data demonstrate that a large fraction of extragenic {Pol\_II} transcription sites can be ascribed to cis-regulatory genomic regions. Discrimination between {lncRNAs} generated by canonical {RNA} genes and products of transcribed enhancers will provide a framework for experimental approaches to {lncRNAs} and help complete the annotation of mammalian genomes.},

This is important, as dysregulated expression of these genes is implicated in susceptibility to many autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases. We describe here a novel regulatory element in the fourth exon of {LTB,} which is highly conserved, localises to the only {CpG} island in the locus, and is associated with a {DNase} I hypersensitive site and specific histone modifications. We find evidence of binding by Yin Yang 1 {(YY1),} cyclic {AMP} response element {(CRE)-binding} protein {(CREB)} and {CCCTC-binding} factor {(CTCF)} to this region in Jurkat T cells, which is associated with transcriptional repression on reporter gene analysis. Chromatin conformation capture experiments show evidence of {DNA} looping, involving interaction of this element with the {LTB} promoter, {LTA} promoter and {TNF} 3′ untranslated region {(UTR).} Small interfering {RNA} {(siRNA)} experiments demonstrate a functional role for {YY1} and {CREB} in {LTB} expression.

  abstract={Evaluation of the preclinical phases of the classic autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis has been facilitated by the availability of autoantibody and genetic markers that point firmly towards the early dysregulation of the adaptive immune responses. The association of psoriatic disease with the human leucocyte {antigen—Cw0602} {(HLA-Cw0602)} gene has likewise led to the perception that autoimmunity has a pivotal role in early psoriatic arthritis {(PsA).} However, this {HLA-Cw0602} genetic association does not appear to hold for {PsA} or associated nail, scalp and intergluteal skin involvement. Of note, these three sites of psoriasis are predictive of {PsA} evolution. For initiation of both skin and nail disease there is a link with Koebnerisation, or site-specific trauma. Nail disease is most common in the dominant hand thumbnail, pointing towards local tissue factors as disease initiators Likewise, for {PsA,} there is also good evidence for a history of previous joint trauma and histological studies showing microdamage in normal entheses which are typical locations where {PsA} frequently occurs. Furthermore, subclinical enthesopathy including osteitis is common in subjects with psoriasis but without arthritis. Collectively, these findings indicate that the classic model of adaptive immune dysregulation does not generally hold for the early stages of {PsA.} The way in which knowledge pertaining to tissue-specific factors in {PsA,} combined with the emerging data relating to monogenic disorders and animal models, points towards perturbation in the healing response and dysregulation of innate immune responses in early {PsA} is discussed. The way in which this model explains the clinical disconnect between skin and joint disease and the emerging human data that support it are demonstrated.},

The tissue factor gene is selectively expressed in highly invasive breast cancer cells, and the mechanisms regulating tissue factor expression in these cells remain unclear. This study demonstrates that {microRNA-19} {(miR-19)} regulates tissue factor expression in breast cancer cells, providing a molecular basis for the selective expression of the tissue factor gene. Tissue factor protein was barely detectable in {MCF-7,} {T47D,} and {ZR-75-1} cells (less invasive breast lines) but was expressed at a significantly higher level in {MDA-MB-231} and {BT-20} cells (invasive breast lines) as assayed by Western blot. The tissue factor gene promoter was activated, and forced expression of tissue factor {cDNA} was achieved in {MCF-7} cells, implying that the {3'-UTR} of the tissue factor transcript is responsible for the suppression of tissue factor expression. Bioinformatics analysis predicted {microRNA-binding} sites for {miR-19,} {miR-20,} and {miR-106b} in the {3'-UTR} of the tissue factor transcript. Reporter gene assay using the {TF-3'-UTR} luciferase reporter construct confirmed that the {3'-UTR} negatively regulates gene expression in {MCF-7} cells, an effect reversed by deletion of the {miR-19-binding} site. Application of the {miR-19} inhibitor induces endogenous tissue factor expression in {MCF-7} cells, and overexpression of {miR-19} down-regulates tissue factor expression in {MDA-MB-231} cells. {RT-PCR} analysis using {cDNA} made from Ago2-immunoprecipitated {RNA} samples confirmed that Ago2 binds preferentially to tissue factor {3'-UTR} in {MCF-7} cells, as compared with {MDA-MB-231} cells, consistent with the observation that {miR-19} levels are higher in {MCF-7} cells.},

However, we demonstrate that mast cells and neutrophils, not T cells, are the predominant cell types that contain {IL-17} in human skin. {IL-17+} mast cells and neutrophils are found at higher densities than {IL-17+} T cells in psoriasis lesions and frequently release {IL-17} in the process of forming specialized structures called extracellular traps.

However, we were unable to identify comparable structures in the 3' {UTRs} of other targets of {SMD.} Here we show that {STAU1-binding} sites can be formed by imperfect base-pairing between an Alu element in the 3' {UTR} of an {SMD} target and another Alu element in a cytoplasmic, polyadenylated long non-coding {RNA} {(lncRNA).} An individual {lncRNA} can downregulate a subset of {SMD} targets, and distinct {lncRNAs} can downregulate the same {SMD} target. These are previously unappreciated functions of non-coding {RNAs} and Alu elements. Not all {mRNAs} that contain an Alu element in the 3' {UTR} are targeted for {SMD} even in the presence of a complementary {lncRNA} that targets other {mRNAs} for {SMD.} Most known trans-acting {RNA} effectors consist of fewer than 200 nucleotides, and these include small nucleolar {RNAs} and {microRNAs.} Our finding that the binding of {STAU1} to {mRNAs} can be transactivated by {lncRNAs} uncovers an unexpected strategy that cells use to recruit proteins to {mRNAs} and mediate the decay of these {mRNAs.} We name these {lncRNAs} {half-STAU1-binding} site {RNAs} {(1/2-sbsRNAs).}},

To this end, we review data relevant to critical parameters in peripheral blood mononuclear cell {(PBMC)} isolation, (cryo)preservation, distribution and usage for detecting antigen-specific T cell responses. Based on these data, we propose recommendations on processing blood samples for T cell assays and identify gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed.

By analyzing 800 million sequences that were obtained from various types of transcriptome analyses, we characterized 140 million {TSS} tags in 12 human cell types. Despite the large number of {TSS} clusters {(TSCs),} the number of {TSCs} was observed to decrease sharply with increasing expression levels. Highly expressed {TSCs} exhibited several characteristic features: Nucleosome-seq analysis revealed highly ordered nucleosome structures, {ChIP-seq} analysis detected clear {RNA} polymerase {II} binding signals in their surrounding regions, evaluations of previously sequenced and newly shotgun-sequenced complete {cDNA} sequences showed that they encode preferable transcripts for protein translation, and {RNA-seq} analysis of polysome-incorporated {RNAs} yielded direct evidence that those transcripts are actually translated into proteins. We also demonstrate that integrative interpretation of transcriptome data is essential for the selection of putative alternative promoter {TSCs,} two of which also have protein consequences. Furthermore, discriminative chromatin features that separate {TSCs} at different expression levels were found for both genic {TSCs} and intergenic {TSCs.} The collected integrative information should provide a useful basis for future biological characterization of {TSCs.}},

  abstract={The human genome contains many thousands of long noncoding {RNAs} {(lncRNAs).} While several studies have demonstrated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to investigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive {lncRNA} annotation. Here, we present and analyze the most complete human {lncRNA} annotation to date, produced by the {GENCODE} consortium within the framework of the {ENCODE} project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that {lncRNAs} are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, {lncRNAs} display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small {RNAs.} They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences—particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that {lncRNAs} are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific {lncRNAs} expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that {lncRNAs} show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This {GENCODE} annotation represents a valuable resource for future studies of {lncRNAs.}},

These are especially seen in younger patients with more severe disease, and are believed to contribute to the 3- to 4-year reduction in life expectancy among patients with severe psoriasis. The recent results of large studies indicate that the increased cardiovascular {(CV)} risk is at least partially attributable to psoriasis and independent of the presence of metabolic co-morbidities. The possible interplay between psoriasis and {CV} disease is complex. Metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes have overlapping genetic predispositions with psoriasis. Both conditions are likely to also interact at a functional level because obesity and the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators in psoriasis appear to influence adipocyte homoeostasis, inducing non-professional immune functions. This may perpetuate psoriatic inflammation, displaying similarities to the immunopathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Finally, the disturbed adipokine profile and inflammation associated with psoriasis enhances insulin resistance, causing subsequent endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and eventual coronary events. The differential contribution of psoriasis and uncontrolled classical {CV} risk factors to the increased {CV} risk seen in psoriasis patients is not clear. Successful treatment with methotrexate appears to lower the rates of {MI} in patients with psoriasis. Tumour necrosis factor-α {(TNF-α)} inhibitors are known to counteract insulin resistance and emerging studies demonstrate an even higher protective effect of {TNF-α} antagonist therapy against the development of diabetes or {CV} co-morbidities in patients. The recent data reviewed here indicate a role for earlier and more appropriate treatment of psoriasis with drugs such as {TNF-α} antagonists. Such an approach has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes through the treatment of psoriasis itself and possibly also in protection against co-morbidities.},

Also the {PBMCs} response to {PHA} was measured after 48 h using {MTT} assay. The effects of the different variables were calculated and compared among the groups. A total of 192 {PBMCs} cryotubes made from blood samples of 16 volunteers were tested. The viability of the cells obtained by the two centrifugation procedure was the same (both more than 99\%). The concentration of the {FBS} (40 vs 70\%) did not show to have significant effects on either cells viability or response to {PHA.} On the other hand 20\% {DMSO} concentration and freezing temperature at {25(o)C} decreased both cells. Based on the obtained results, it is recommended to centrifuge the {PBMCs} under higher revolt speed at shorter time (700 g for 20 minutes) and decrease the {FBS} concentration to 40\%.

  abstract={Most of the mammalian genome is transcribed. This generates a vast repertoire of transcripts that includes protein-coding messenger {RNAs,} long non-coding {RNAs} {(lncRNAs)} and repetitive sequences, such as {SINEs} (short interspersed nuclear elements). A large percentage of {ncRNAs} are nuclear-enriched with unknown function. Antisense {lncRNAs} may form sense-antisense pairs by pairing with a protein-coding gene on the opposite strand to regulate epigenetic silencing, transcription and {mRNA} stability. Here we identify a nuclear-enriched {lncRNA} antisense to mouse ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 {(Uchl1),} a gene involved in brain function and neurodegenerative diseases. Antisense Uchl1 increases {UCHL1} protein synthesis at a post-transcriptional level, hereby identifying a new functional class of {lncRNAs.} Antisense Uchl1 activity depends on the presence of a 5' overlapping sequence and an embedded inverted {SINEB2} element. These features are shared by other natural antisense transcripts and can confer regulatory activity to an artificial antisense to green fluorescent protein. Antisense Uchl1 function is under the control of stress signalling pathways, as {mTORC1} inhibition by rapamycin causes an increase in {UCHL1} protein that is associated to the shuttling of antisense Uchl1 {RNA} from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Antisense Uchl1 {RNA} is then required for the association of the overlapping sense protein-coding {mRNA} to active polysomes for translation. These data reveal another layer of gene expression control at the post-transcriptional level.},

We recently demonstrated that {PAN} {RNA} interacts with several viral and cellular factors and can disregulate the expression of genes that modulate immune response. In an effort to define the role of {PAN} {RNA} in the context of the virus genome we generated a recombinant {BACmid} that deleted the {PAN} {RNA} locus. Because of the apparent duplication of the {PAN} {RNA} locus in {BAC36,} we generated {BAC36CR,} a recombinant {BACmid} that removes the duplicated region. {BAC36CR} was used as a template to delete most of the {PAN} {RNA} locus to generate {BAC36CR\&\#x394;PAN.} {BAC36CR\&\#x394;PAN} failed to produce supernatant virus and displayed a general decrease in {mRNA} accumulation of representative immediate early, early and late genes. Most strikingly, {K-Rta} expression was decreased in lytically induced {BAC36CR\&\#x394;PAN-containing} cell lines at early and late time points post induction. Expression of {PAN} {RNA} in trans in {BAC36CR\&\#x394;PAN} containing cells resulted in an increase in {K-Rta} expression, however {K-Rta} over expression failed to rescue {BAC36CR\&\#x394;PAN,} suggesting that {PAN} {RNA} plays a wider role in virus replication. To investigate the role of {PAN} {RNA} in the activation of {K-Rta} expression, we demonstrate that {PAN} {RNA} physically interacts with the {ORF50} promoter. {RNA} chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that {PAN} {RNA} interacts with demethylases {JMJD3} and {UTX,} and the histone methyltransferase {MLL2.} Consistent with the interaction with demethylases, expression of {PAN} {RNA} results in a decrease of the repressive {H3K27me3} mark at the {ORF50} promoter. These data support a model where {PAN} {RNA} is a multifunctional regulatory transcript that controls {KSHV} gene expression by mediating the modification of chromatin by targeting the {KSHV} repressed genome.},

  abstract={Atopic eczema and psoriasis are common skin diseases. While it is well established that the pathogenesis of these diseases varies, both are characterized by impairment in epidermal barrier function and abnormal {IL-17} expression in the skin and peripheral blood. Recent findings indicated that filaggrin is essential during barrier formation and its insufficiency underlies the pathogenesis of atopic eczema. Filaggrin downregulation has also been reported in psoriasis. It is clear that {Th1/Th2} bias influences expression of the protein, but an analysis of the effects of interleukin-17 {(IL-17)} on the expression of the protein and profilaggrin-processing enzymes has not yet been reported. In addition, the effect of the cytokine on components of functional epidermal barrier, tight junctions and adhesion/desmosomal proteins, has not been elucidated. Keratinocytes were exposed to {interleukin-17A,} and microarray analysis was performed. Filaggrin protein level was assessed by western blot. We have observed a significant decrease in profilaggrin {mRNA} level in {interleukin-17A-exposed} cultures {(P~=~0.008).} Expression of processing enzymes was also altered, indicating an indirect effect of the cytokine on filaggrin production/degradation. Moreover, expression of many genes involved in cellular adhesion was also decreased. A significant downregulation of filaggrin at the protein level was detected by western blot in immortal and primary keratinocytes. Gene ontology analysis indicated changes in keratinization, epidermal differentiation and formation of the cornified envelope. We conclude that {IL-17A} downregulates the expression of filaggrin and genes important for cellular adhesion which could affect epidermal barrier formation. This effect potentially contributes to barrier dysfunction and could become a possible therapeutic target.},

  abstract={In the acute phase of atopic dermatitis {(AD),} T-helper type 2 {(Th2)} cytokines characterize the inflammatory response in the skin. {IL-33} is a new tissue-derived cytokine, which is mainly expressed by cells of barrier tissues, and is known to activate Th2 lymphocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils. {IL-33} signals through a receptor complex consisting of {IL-33-specific} receptor {ST2} and a co-receptor {IL-1RAcP.} As {IL-33} is known to promote Th2-type immunity, we examined expression profiles of {IL-33} and its receptor components in human {AD} skin, in the murine model of {AD,} and in various cell models. We found increased expression of {IL-33} and {ST2} in {AD} skin after allergen or staphylococcal enterotoxin B {(SEB)} exposure, as well as in the skin of 22-week-old filaggrin-deficient mice. In addition, skin fibroblasts, {HaCaT} keratinocytes, primary macrophages, and {HUVEC} endothelial cells efficiently produced {IL-33} in response to the combined stimulation of tumor necrosis {factor-\&\#x3B1;} and {IFN-\&\#x3B3;,} which was further enhanced by a mimetic of double-stranded {RNA.} Finally, the increased expression of {IL-33} and {ST2} caused by irritant, allergen, or {SEB} challenge was suppressed by topical tacrolimus treatment.

While chromatin structure prior to receptor binding and nucleosome occupancy after binding are strikingly different for {ESR1} and {AR,} {ΔDHS} is highly predictive for both. {AR} binding is associated with changes in both local nucleosome occupancy and {DNase} I hypersensitivity. In contrast, while global {ESR1} binding is unrelated to changes in nucleosome occupancy, {DNase} I hypersensitivity dynamics are also predictive of the {ESR1} cistrome. These findings suggest that {AR} and {ESR1} have distinct modes of interaction with chromatin and that {DNase} I hypersensitivity dynamics provides a general approach for predicting cell-type specific cistromes.},

  abstract={Nucleosomes are important for gene regulation because their arrangement on the genome can control which proteins bind to {DNA.} Currently, few human nucleosomes are thought to be consistently positioned across cells; however, this has been difficult to assess due to the limited resolution of existing data. We performed paired-end sequencing of micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin {(MNase–seq)} from seven lymphoblastoid cell lines and mapped over 3.6 billion {MNase–seq} fragments to the human genome to create the highest-resolution map of nucleosome occupancy to date in a human cell type. In contrast to previous results, we find that most nucleosomes have more consistent positioning than expected by chance and a substantial fraction (8.7\%) of nucleosomes have moderate to strong positioning. In aggregate, nucleosome sequences have 10 bp periodic patterns in dinucleotide frequency and {DNase} I sensitivity; and, across cells, nucleosomes frequently have translational offsets that are multiples of 10 bp. We estimate that almost half of the genome contains regularly spaced arrays of nucleosomes, which are enriched in active chromatin domains. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce {DNase} I sensitivity can disrupt the phasing of nucleosome arrays, which indicates that they often result from positioning against a barrier formed by other proteins. However, nucleosome arrays can also be created by {DNA} sequence alone. The most striking example is an array of over 400 nucleosomes on chromosome 12 that is created by tandem repetition of sequences with strong positioning properties. In summary, a large fraction of nucleosomes are consistently positioned—in some regions because they adopt favored sequence positions, and in other regions because they are forced into specific arrangements by chromatin remodeling or {DNA} binding proteins.},

These enhancers exist in accessible chromatin regions and are associated with various histone modifications and polymerase {II} binding. The promoters with interacting enhancers are expressed at higher levels than those without interacting enhancers, and their expression levels are positively correlated with the number of interacting enhancers. Interestingly, interacting promoters are co-expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We also find that chromosomes are organized into multiple levels of interacting domains.

  abstract={As the sequencing of healthy and disease genomes becomes more commonplace, detailed annotation provides interpretation for individual variation responsible for normal and disease phenotypes. Current approaches focus on direct changes in protein coding genes, particularly nonsynonymous mutations that directly affect the gene product. However, most individual variation occurs outside of genes and, indeed, most markers generated from genome-wide association studies {(GWAS)} identify variants outside of coding segments. Identification of potential regulatory changes that perturb these sites will lead to a better localization of truly functional variants and interpretation of their effects. We have developed a novel approach and database, {RegulomeDB,} which guides interpretation of regulatory variants in the human genome. {RegulomeDB} includes high-throughput, experimental data sets from {ENCODE} and other sources, as well as computational predictions and manual annotations to identify putative regulatory potential and identify functional variants. These data sources are combined into a powerful tool that scores variants to help separate functional variants from a large pool and provides a small set of putative sites with testable hypotheses as to their function. We demonstrate the applicability of this tool to the annotation of noncoding variants from 69 full sequenced genomes as well as that of a personal genome, where thousands of functionally associated variants were identified.

Three factors need to be considered when comparing experimental results from studies in mice and humans: In addition to species-specific differences, phenotypes are affected by the genetic background of the mouse strain being analyzed, and by microbial factors.

  abstract={While studies to associate genomic variants to complex traits have gradually become increasingly productive, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these associations are rarely understood. Because only a small fraction of trait-associated variants can be linked to coding sequences, investigators have speculated that many of the underlying causal alleles influence non-coding gene regulatory sites. Recent studies have successfully identified examples of mechanisms for non-coding alleles at individual loci. Now, genome-wide chromatin assays have resulted in maps of dozens of genomic annotations of the non-coding genome across multiple different tissues, cell types and cell lines. This gives a tremendous opportunity to integrate these annotations with complex trait signals to globally interpret associated variants, and prioritize likely causal alleles. Here, we review the examples of mechanisms by which non-coding, common alleles result in phenotypes. We discuss the efforts to integrate common trait-associated variants with genomic annotations. Finally, we highlight some caveats of these approaches and outline future directions for improvement.},

A critical step in {RNA-seq} data analysis is the alignment of partial transcript reads to a reference genome sequence. To assess the performance of current mapping software, we invited developers of {RNA-seq} aligners to process four large human and mouse {RNA-seq} data sets. In total, we compared 26 mapping protocols based on 11 programs and pipelines and found major performance differences between methods on numerous benchmarks, including alignment yield, basewise accuracy, mismatch and gap placement, exon junction discovery and suitability of alignments for transcript reconstruction. We observed concordant results on real and simulated {RNA-seq} data, confirming the relevance of the metrics employed. Future developments in {RNA-seq} alignment methods would benefit from improved placement of multimapped reads, balanced utilization of existing gene annotation and a reduced false discovery rate for splice junctions.},

  abstract={Genome-wide chromatin annotations have permitted the mapping of putative regulatory elements across multiple human cell types. However, their experimental dissection by directed regulatory motif disruption has remained unfeasible at the genome scale. Here, we use a massively parallel reporter assay {(MPRA)} to measure the transcriptional levels induced by 145-bp {DNA} segments centered on evolutionarily conserved regulatory motif instances within enhancer chromatin states. We select five predicted activators {(HNF1,} {HNF4,} {FOXA,} {GATA,} {NFE2L2)} and two predicted repressors {(GFI1,} {ZFP161)} and measure reporter expression in erythroleukemia {(K562)} and liver carcinoma {(HepG2)} cell lines. We test 2104 wild-type sequences and 3314 engineered enhancer variants containing targeted motif disruptions, each using 10 barcode tags and two replicates. The resulting data strongly confirm the enhancer activity and cell-type specificity of enhancer chromatin states, the ability of 145-bp segments to recapitulate both, the necessary role of regulatory motifs in enhancer function, and the complementary roles of activator and repressor motifs. We find statistically robust evidence that (1) disrupting the predicted activator motifs abolishes enhancer function, while silent or motif-improving changes maintain enhancer activity; (2) evolutionary conservation, nucleosome exclusion, binding of other factors, and strength of the motif match are predictive of enhancer activity; (3) scrambling repressor motifs leads to aberrant reporter expression in cell lines where the enhancers are usually inactive. Our results suggest a general strategy for deciphering cis-regulatory elements by systematic large-scale manipulation and provide quantitative enhancer activity measurements across thousands of constructs that can be mined to develop predictive models of gene expression.},

In this study we analyzed the effect of an overnight resting period at 37 {\&\#xB0;C} on the quantity and functionality of {HIV-1,} {EBV,} {CMV,} {HBV} and {HCV} specific {CD4} and {CD8} T-cell responses in a cohort of 21 individuals.

After an overnight resting significantly higher numbers of functionally active T cells were detectable by {ICS} for all tested antigen specificities, whereas the total number of antigen specific T cells determined by multimer staining remained unchanged. Overnight resting shifted the quality of T-cell responses towards polyfunctionality and increased antigen sensitivity of T cells. Our data suggest that the observed effect is mediated by T cells rather than by antigen presenting cells. We conclude that overnight resting of {PBMC} prior to ex vivo analysis of antiviral T-cell responses represents an efficient method to increase sensitivity of {ICS-based} methods and has a prominent impact on the functional phenotype of T cells.},

  abstract={Deep sequencing of mammalian {DNA} methylomes has uncovered a previously unpredicted number of discrete hypomethylated regions in intergenic space {(iHMRs).} Here, we combined whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data with extensive gene expression and chromatin-state data to define functional classes of {iHMRs,} and to reconstruct the dynamics of their establishment in a developmental setting. Comparing {HMR} profiles in embryonic stem and primary blood cells, we show that {iHMRs} mark an exclusive subset of active {DNase} hypersensitive sites {(DHS),} and that both developmentally constitutive and cell-type-specific {iHMRs} display chromatin states typical of distinct regulatory elements. We also observe that {iHMR} changes are more predictive of nearby gene activity than the promoter {HMR} itself, and that expression of noncoding {RNAs} within the {iHMR} accompanies full activation and complete demethylation of mature B cell enhancers. Conserved sequence features corresponding to {iHMR} transcript start sites, including a discernible {TATA} motif, suggest a conserved, functional role for transcription in these regions. Similarly, we explored both primate-specific and human population variation at {iHMRs,} finding that while enhancer {iHMRs} are more variable in sequence and methylation status than any other functional class, conservation of the {TATA} box is highly predictive of {iHMR} maintenance, reflecting the impact of sequence plasticity and transcriptional signals on {iHMR} establishment. Overall, our analysis allowed us to construct a three-step timeline in which (1) intergenic {DHS} are pre-established in the stem cell, (2) partial demethylation of blood-specific intergenic {DHSs} occurs in blood progenitors, and (3) complete {iHMR} formation and transcription coincide with enhancer activation in lymphoid-specified cells.},

Of particular interest is the discovery of differentially expressed genes across different conditions (e.g., tissues, perturbations) while optionally adjusting for other systematic factors that affect the data-collection process. There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices.

  abstract={Arthritis mutilans is described as the most severe form of psoriatic arthritis. It is characterized by digital shortening associated with severe osteolysis of peripheral joints. Research on arthritis mutilans has been impeded by lack of an accepted case definition. Here we describe the definitions used to date, epidemiology, clinical and radiological features, and clues to pathogenesis of arthritis mutilans. An initiative by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis {(GRAPPA)} to develop a consensus definition is described. The purpose of the {GRAPPA} initiative is to assist studies identifying clinical predictors and biomarkers for arthritis mutilans, so that patients at risk are identified early and appropriate therapeutic intervention is instituted to prevent joint destruction and preserve quality of life and function.},

  abstract={Genome-wide association studies {(GWAS)} have reproducibly associated variants within introns of {FTO} with increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes {(T2D).} Although the molecular mechanisms linking these noncoding variants with obesity are not immediately obvious, subsequent studies in mice demonstrated that {FTO} expression levels influence body mass and composition phenotypes. However, no direct connection between the obesity-associated variants and {FTO} expression or function has been made. Here we show that the obesity-associated noncoding sequences within {FTO} are functionally connected, at megabase distances, with the homeobox gene {IRX3.} The obesity-associated {FTO} region directly interacts with the promoters of {IRX3} as well as {FTO} in the human, mouse and zebrafish genomes. Furthermore, long-range enhancers within this region recapitulate aspects of {IRX3} expression, suggesting that the obesity-associated interval belongs to the regulatory landscape of {IRX3.} Consistent with this, obesity-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with expression of {IRX3,} but not {FTO,} in human brains. A direct link between {IRX3} expression and regulation of body mass and composition is demonstrated by a reduction in body weight of 25 to 30\% in Irx3-deficient mice, primarily through the loss of fat mass and increase in basal metabolic rate with browning of white adipose tissue. Finally, hypothalamic expression of a dominant-negative form of Irx3 reproduces the metabolic phenotypes of Irx3-deficient mice. Our data suggest that {IRX3} is a functional long-range target of obesity-associated variants within {FTO} and represents a novel determinant of body mass and composition.},

  abstract={{MicroRNAs} {(miRNAs)} are short (19-23 nucleotides) non-coding {RNAs} that bind to sites in the 3'untranslated regions {(3'UTR)} of a targeted messenger {RNA} {(mRNA).} Binding leads to degradation of the transcript or blocked translation resulting in decreased expression of the targeted gene. Single nucleotide polymorphisms {(SNPs)} have been found in {3'UTRs} that disrupt normal {miRNA} binding or introduce new binding sites and some of these have been associated with disease pathogenesis. This raises the importance of detecting {miRNA} targets and predicting the possible effects of {SNPs} on binding sites. In the last decade a number of studies have been conducted to predict the location of {miRNA} binding sites. However, there have been fewer algorithms published to analyze the effects of {SNPs} on {miRNA} binding. Moreover, the existing software has some shortcomings including the requirement for significant manual labor when working with huge lists of {SNPs} and that algorithms work only for {SNPs} present in databases such as {dbSNP.} These limitations become problematic as next-generation sequencing is leading to large numbers of novel variants in {3'UTRs.}},

In humans, molecular studies have suggested a functional role for {lincRNAs} in cancer development. The aim of the present study was to examine whether these novel molecules are specifically regulated by different cytokines in cells of the innate immune system in humans in vivo and whether {lincRNAs} thereby might be involved in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis {(RA).} Therefore, {CD14(+)} monocytes were isolated from {RA} patients before and after {anti-IL-6R} (tocilizumab) or {anti-TNF-\&\#x3B1;} (adalimumab) therapy and {lincRNA} transcription was analysed by a microarray based experiment. As expected, we found {lincRNAs} to be present in {CD14(+)} monocytes of {RA} patients. However, of the total number of 7.419 {lincRNAs} examined in this study only a very small number was significantly regulated by either {IL-6} or {TNF-\&\#x3B1;} (85 {lincRNAs,} corresponding to 1.1\%). The numbers of {lincRNAs} regulated was higher due to {TNF-\&\#x3B1;} compared to {IL-6.} Interestingly, none of the identified {lincRNAs} was influenced by both, {IL-6} and {TNF-\&\#x3B1;,} suggesting the regulation of {lincRNA} transcription to be highly specific for distinct cytokines. Taken together, our results suggest (1) that {lincRNAs} are novel intracellular molecular effectors of specific cytokines in cells of the innate immune system in humans in vivo and (2) that {lincRNAs} might be involved in the molecular pathophysiology of {RA.} },

  abstract={Protection against reinfection is mediated by Ag-specific memory {CD8} T cells, which display stem cell-like function. Because canonical Wnt {(Wingless/Int1)} signals critically regulate renewal versus differentiation of adult stem cells, we evaluated Wnt signal transduction in {CD8} T cells during an immune response to acute infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Whereas naive {CD8} T cells efficiently transduced Wnt signals, at the peak of the primary response to infection only a fraction of effector T cells retained signal transduction and the majority displayed strongly reduced Wnt activity. Reduced Wnt signaling was in part due to the downregulation of Tcf-1, one of the nuclear effectors of the pathway, and coincided with progress toward terminal differentiation. However, the correlation between low and high Wnt levels with short-lived and memory precursor effector cells, respectively, was incomplete. Adoptive transfer studies showed that low and high Wnt signaling did not influence cell survival but that Wnt high effectors yielded memory cells with enhanced proliferative potential and stronger protective capacity. Likewise, following adoptive transfer and rechallenge, memory cells with high Wnt levels displayed increased recall expansion, compared with memory cells with low Wnt signaling, which were preferentially effector-like memory cells, including tissue-resident memory cells. Thus, canonical Wnt signaling identifies {CD8} T cells with enhanced proliferative potential in part independent of commonly used cell surface markers to discriminate effector and memory T cell subpopulations. Interventions that maintain Wnt signaling may thus improve the formation of functional {CD8} T cell memory during vaccination. },

  abstract={The Illumina {NexteraXT} transposon protocol is a cost effective way to generate paired end libraries. However the resulting insert size is highly sensitive to the concentration of {DNA} used, and the variation of insert sizes is often large. One consequence of this is some fragments may have an insert shorter than the length of a single read, particularly where the library is designed to produce overlapping paired end reads in order to produce longer continuous sequences. Such small insert sizes mean fewer longer reads, and also result in the presence of adapter at the end of the read. Here is presented a protocol to use publicly available tools to identify read pairs with small insert sizes and so likely to contain adapter, to check the sequence of the adapter, and remove adapter sequence from the reads. This protocol does not require a reference genome or prior knowledge of the sequence to be trimmed. Whilst the presence of fragments with small insert sizes may be a particular problem for {NexteraXT} libraries, the principle can be applied to any Illumina dataset in which the presence of such small inserts is suspected.},

Post-initiation transcript stability provides a more fundamental distinction between promoters and enhancers than patterns of histone modification and association of transcription factors or co-activators.

  abstract={Regulated transcription controls the diversity, developmental pathways and spatial organization of the hundreds of cell types that make up a mammal. Using single-molecule {cDNA} sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites {(TSSs)} and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly ‘housekeeping’, whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated {TSSs,} with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. {TSSs} specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis reveals key transcription factors defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment analyses. The functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 {(FANTOM5)} project provides comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes with wide applications in biomedical research.},

  abstract={Genome-wide profiling of open chromatin regions using {DNase} I and high-throughput sequencing {(DNase-seq)} is an increasingly popular approach for finding and studying regulatory elements. A variety of algorithms have been developed to identify regions of open chromatin from raw sequence-tag data, which has motivated us to assess and compare their performance. In this study, four published, publicly available peak calling algorithms used for {DNase-seq} data analysis {(F-seq,} Hotspot, {MACS} and {ZINBA)} are assessed at a range of signal thresholds on two published {DNase-seq} datasets for three cell types. The results were benchmarked against an independent dataset of regulatory regions derived from {ENCODE} in vivo transcription factor binding data for each particular cell type. The level of overlap between peak regions reported by each algorithm and this {ENCODE-derived} reference set was used to assess sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms. Our study suggests that F-seq has a slightly higher sensitivity than the next best algorithms. Hotspot and the {ChIP-seq} oriented method, {MACS,} both perform competitively when used with their default parameters. However the generic peak finder {ZINBA} appears to be less sensitive than the other three. We also assess accuracy of each algorithm over a range of signal thresholds. In particular, we show that the accuracy of {F-Seq} can be considerably improved by using a threshold setting that is different from the default value.},

  abstract={Chromatin interactions connect distal regulatory elements to target gene promoters guiding stimulus- and lineage-specific transcription. Few factors securing chromatin interactions have so far been identified. Here, by integrating chromatin interaction maps with the large collection of transcription factor-binding profiles provided by the {ENCODE} project, we demonstrate that the zinc-finger protein {ZNF143} preferentially occupies anchors of chromatin interactions connecting promoters with distal regulatory elements. It binds directly to promoters and associates with lineage-specific chromatin interactions and gene expression. Silencing {ZNF143} or modulating its {DNA-binding} affinity using single-nucleotide polymorphisms {(SNPs)} as a surrogate of site-directed mutagenesis reveals the sequence dependency of chromatin interactions at gene promoters. We also find that chromatin interactions alone do not regulate gene expression. Together, our results identify {ZNF143} as a novel chromatin-looping factor that contributes to the architectural foundation of the genome by providing sequence specificity at promoters connected with distal regulatory elements.},

  abstract={{UBE2L3} is associated with increased susceptibility to numerous autoimmune diseases, but the underlying mechanism is unexplained. By using data from a genome-wide association study of systemic lupus erythematosus {(SLE),} we observed a single risk haplotype spanning {UBE2L3,} consistently aligned across multiple autoimmune diseases, associated with increased {UBE2L3} expression in B cells and monocytes. rs140490 in the {UBE2L3} promoter region showed the strongest association. {UBE2L3} is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, specially adapted to function with {HECT} and {RING-in-between-RING} {(RBR)} E3 ligases, including {HOIL-1} and {HOIP,} components of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex {(LUBAC).} Our data demonstrate that {UBE2L3} is the preferred E2 conjugating enzyme for {LUBAC} {in\&\#xA0;vivo,} and {UBE2L3} is essential for {LUBAC-mediated} activation of {NF-\&\#x3BA;B.} By accurately quantifying {NF-\&\#x3BA;B} translocation in primary human cells from healthy individuals stratified by rs140490 genotype, we observed that the autoimmune disease risk {UBE2L3} genotype was correlated with basal {NF-\&\#x3BA;B} activation in unstimulated B cells and monocytes and regulated the sensitivity of {NF-\&\#x3BA;B} to {CD40} stimulation in B cells and {TNF} stimulation in monocytes. The {UBE2L3} risk allele correlated with increased circulating plasmablast and plasma cell numbers in {SLE} individuals, consistent with substantially elevated {UBE2L3} protein levels in plasmablasts and plasma cells. These results identify key immunological consequences of the {UBE2L3} autoimmune risk haplotype and highlight an important role for {UBE2L3} in plasmablast and plasma cell development.},

However, until recently, we have known little about the mechanisms by which most regulatory variants act. For instance, what types of functional elements in {DNA,} {RNA,} or proteins are most often affected by regulatory variants? Which stages of gene regulation are typically altered? How can we predict which variants are most likely to impact regulation in a given cell type? Recent studies, in many cases using quantitative trait loci {(QTL)-mapping} approaches in cell lines or tissue samples, have provided us with considerable insight into the properties of genetic loci that have regulatory roles. Such studies have uncovered novel biochemical regulatory interactions and led to the identification of previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms. We have learned that genetic variation is often directly associated with variation in regulatory activities (namely, we can map regulatory {QTLs,} not just expression {QTLs} {[eQTLs]),} and we have taken the first steps towards understanding the causal order of regulatory events (for example, the role of pioneer transcription factors). Yet, in most cases, we still do not know how to interpret overlapping combinations of regulatory interactions, and we are still far from being able to predict how variation in regulatory mechanisms is propagated through a chain of interactions to eventually result in changes in gene expression profiles.},

Herein, we show that the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner {(SHP)} is a negative regulator of {NLRP3} inflammasome activation. {NLRP3} inflammasome activation leads to an interaction between {SHP} and {NLRP3,} proteins that are both recruited to mitochondria. Overexpression of {SHP} competitively inhibits binding of {NLRP3} to apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a {CARD} {(ASC).} {SHP} deficiency results in increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines {IL-1\&\#x3B2;} and {IL-18,} and excessive pathologic responses typically observed in mouse models of kidney tubular necrosis and peritoneal gout. Notably, the loss of {SHP} results in accumulation of damaged mitochondria and a sustained interaction between {NLRP3} and {ASC} in the endoplasmic reticulum. These data are suggestive of a role for {SHP} in controlling {NLRP3} inflammasome activation through a mechanism involving interaction with {NLRP3} and maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis.},

  abstract={Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity. Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical {DNA} sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian {DNA} regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing {(ATAC-seq)} integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell {ATAC-seq} {(scATAC-seq)} maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of {DNA} accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.},

  abstract={Most disease associations detected by genome-wide association studies {(GWAS)} lie outside coding genes, but very few have been mapped to causal regulatory variants. Here, we present a method for detecting regulatory quantitative trait loci {(QTLs)} that does not require genotyping or whole-genome sequencing. The method combines deep, long-read chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing {(ChIP-seq)} with a statistical test that simultaneously scores peak height correlation and allelic imbalance: the genotype-independent signal correlation and imbalance {(G-SCI)} test. We performed histone acetylation {ChIP-seq} on 57 human lymphoblastoid cell lines and used the resulting reads to call 500,066 single-nucleotide polymorphisms de novo within regulatory elements. The {G-SCI} test annotated 8,764 of these as histone acetylation {QTLs} {(haQTLs)-an} order of magnitude larger than the set of candidates detected by expression {QTL} analysis. Lymphoblastoid {haQTLs} were highly predictive of autoimmune disease mechanisms.

  abstract={Background Recently mixed linear models are used to address the issue of "missing" heritability in traditional Genome-wide association studies {(GWAS).} The models assume that all single-nucleotide polymorphisms {(SNPs)} are associated with the phenotypes of interest. However, it is more common that only a small proportion of {SNPs} have significant effects on the phenotypes, while most {SNPs} have no or very small effects. To incorporate this feature, we propose an efficient Hierarchical Bayesian Model {(HBM)} that extends the existing mixed models to enforce automatic selection of significant {SNPs.} The {HBM} models the {SNP} effects using a mixture distribution of a point mass at zero and a normal distribution, where the point mass corresponds to those non-associative {SNPs.} Results We estimate the {HBM} using Gibbs sampling. The estimation performance of our method is first demonstrated through two simulation studies. We make the simulation setups realistic by using parameters fitted on the Framingham Heart Study {(FHS)} data. The simulation studies show that our method can accurately estimate the proportion of {SNPs} associated with the simulated phenotype and identify these {SNPs,} as well as adapt to certain model mis-specification than the standard mixed models. In addition, we analyze data from the {FHS} and the Health and Retirement Study {(HRS)} to study the association between Body Mass Index {(BMI)} and {SNPs} on Chromosome 16, and replicate the identified genetic associations. The analysis of the {FHS} data identifies 0.3\% {SNPs} on Chromosome 16 that affect {BMI,} including rs9939609 and rs9939973 on the {FTO} gene. These two {SNPs} are in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1558902 {(Rsq=0.901} for rs9939609 and Rsq=0.905 for rs9939973), which has been reported to be linked with obesity in previous {GWAS.} We then replicate the findings using the {HRS} data: the analysis finds 0.4\% of {SNPs} associated with {BMI} on Chromosome 16. Furthermore, around 25\% of the genes that are identified to be associated with {BMI} are common between the two studies. Conclusions The results demonstrate that the {HBM} and the associated estimation algorithm offer a powerful tool for identifying significant genetic associations with phenotypes of interest, among a large number of {SNPs} that are common in modern genetics studies.},

  abstract={Transcriptional control in large genomes often requires looping interactions between distal {DNA} elements, such as enhancers and target promoters. Current chromosome conformation capture techniques do not offer sufficiently high resolution to interrogate these regulatory interactions on a genomic scale. Here we use Capture {Hi-C} {(CHi-C),} an adapted genome conformation assay, to examine the long-range interactions of almost 22,000 promoters in 2 human blood cell types. We identify over 1.6 million shared and cell type–restricted interactions spanning hundreds of kilobases between promoters and distal loci. Transcriptionally active genes contact enhancer-like elements, whereas transcriptionally inactive genes interact with previously uncharacterized elements marked by repressive features that may act as long-range silencers. Finally, we show that interacting loci are enriched for disease-associated {SNPs,} suggesting how distal mutations may disrupt the regulation of relevant genes. This study provides new insights and accessible tools to dissect the regulatory interactions that underlie normal and aberrant gene regulation.},

Here we examine the requirement of Integrator in the biogenesis of transcripts derived from distal regulatory elements (enhancers) involved in tissue- and temporal-specific regulation of gene expression in metazoans. Integrator is recruited to enhancers and super-enhancers in a stimulus-dependent manner. Functional depletion of Integrator subunits diminishes the signal-dependent induction of enhancer {RNAs} {(eRNAs)} and abrogates stimulus-induced enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. Global nuclear run-on and {RNAPII} profiling reveals a role for Integrator in 3'-end cleavage of {eRNA} primary transcripts leading to transcriptional termination. In the absence of Integrator, {eRNAs} remain bound to {RNAPII} and their primary transcripts accumulate. Notably, the induction of {eRNAs} and gene expression responsiveness requires the catalytic activity of Integrator complex. We propose a role for Integrator in biogenesis of {eRNAs} and enhancer function in metazoans.},

Translating those associations into knowledge of disease mechanisms remains a fundamental challenge because the associated variants are overwhelmingly in noncoding regions of the genome where we have few guiding principles to predict their function. Intersecting the compendium of identified genetic associations with maps of regulatory activity across the human genome has revealed that phenotype-associated variants are highly enriched in candidate regulatory elements. Allele-specific analyses of gene regulation can further prioritize variants that likely have a functional effect on disease mechanisms; and emerging high-throughput assays to quantify the activity of candidate regulatory elements are a promising next step in that direction. Together, these technologies have created the ability to systematically and empirically test hypotheses about the function of noncoding variants and haplotypes at the scale needed for comprehensive and systematic follow-up of genetic association studies. Major coordinated efforts to quantify regulatory mechanisms across genetically diverse populations in increasingly realistic cell models would be highly beneficial to realize that potential.},

Genome-wide studies demonstrate a high degree of genetic overlap, but these diseases have mutually exclusive clinical phenotypes and opposing immune mechanisms. Despite their prevalence, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis very rarely co-occur within one individual. By utilizing genome-wide association study and {ImmunoChip} data from \&gt;19,000 individuals and methodologies developed from meta-analysis, we have identified opposing risk alleles at shared loci as well as independent disease-specific loci within the epidermal differentiation complex (chromosome 1q21.3), the Th2 locus control region (chromosome 5q31.1), and the major histocompatibility complex (chromosome 6p21-22). We further identified previously unreported pleiotropic alleles with opposing effects on atopic dermatitis and psoriasis risk in {PRKRA} and {ANXA6/TNIP1.} In contrast, there was no evidence for shared loci with effects operating in the same direction on both diseases. Our results show that atopic dermatitis and psoriasis have distinct genetic mechanisms with opposing effects in shared pathways influencing epidermal differentiation and immune response. The statistical analysis methods developed in the conduct of this study have produced additional insight from previously published data sets. The approach is likely to be applicable to the investigation of the genetic basis of other complex traits with overlapping and distinct clinical features.},

  abstract={Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease whose prevalence varies among different populations worldwide. It is a complex multi-factorial disease and the exact etiology is largely unknown. Family based studies have indicated a genetic predisposition; however they cannot fully explain the disease pathogenesis. In addition to genetic susceptibility, environmental as well as gender and age related factors were also been found to be associated. Recently, imbalances in epigenetic networks are indicated to be causative elements in psoriasis. The present knowledge of epigenetic involvement, mainly the {DNA} methylation, chromatin modifications and {miRNA} deregulation is surveyed here. An integrated approach considering genetic and epigenetic anomalies in the light of immunological network may explore the pathogenesis of psoriasis.},

We also map “multipeak” {caQTLs,} identical genetic associations found across multiple, independent open chromatin regions and illustrate how genetic signals in {ATAC-seq} data can be used to link distal regulatory elements with gene promoters.

  abstract={The response of psoriasis to antibodies targeting the interleukin {(IL)-23/IL-17A} pathway suggests a prominent role of T-helper type-17 {(Th17)} cells in this disease. We examined the clinical and immunological response patterns of 100 subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis receiving 3 different intravenous dosing regimens of the {anti-IL-17A} antibody secukinumab (1~{\texttimes}~3~mg/kg or 1~{\texttimes}~10~mg/kg on Day 1, or 3~{\texttimes}~10~mg/kg on Days 1, 15 and 29) or placebo in a phase 2 trial. Baseline biopsies revealed typical features of active psoriasis, including epidermal accumulation of neutrophils and formation of microabscesses in \{\textgreater\}60\% of cases. Neutrophils were the numerically largest fraction of infiltrating cells containing {IL-17} and may store the cytokine preformed, as {IL-17A} {mRNA} was not detectable in neutrophils isolated from active plaques. Significant clinical responses to secukinumab were observed 2~weeks after a single infusion, associated with extensive clearance of cutaneous neutrophils parallel to the normalization of keratinocyte abnormalities and reduction of {IL-17-inducible} neutrophil chemoattractants (e.g. {CXCL1,} {CXCL8);} effects on numbers of T cells and {CD11c-positive} dendritic cells were more delayed. Histological and immunological improvements were generally dose dependent and not observed in the placebo group. In the lowest-dose group, a recurrence of neutrophils was seen in some subjects at Week 12; these subjects relapsed faster than those without microabscesses. Our findings are indicative of a neutrophil–keratinocyte axis in psoriasis that may involve neutrophil-derived {IL-17} and is an early target of {IL-17A-directed} therapies such as secukinumab.},

The combined analysis, consisting of over 15,000 cases and 27,000 controls, identifies five new psoriasis susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance {(P\{\textless\}5} {\texttimes} 10−8). The newly identified signals include two that reside in intergenic regions (1q31.1 and 5p13.1) and three residing near {PLCL2} (3p24.3), {NFKBIZ} (3q12.3) and {CAMK2G} (10q22.2).

  abstract={The most abundant {mRNA} post-transcriptional modification is N(6)-methyladenosine {(m(6)A),} which has broad roles in {RNA} biology. In mammalian cells, the asymmetric distribution of {m(6)A} along {mRNAs} results in relatively less methylation in the 5' untranslated region {(5'UTR)} compared to other regions. However, whether and how {5'UTR} methylation is regulated is poorly understood. Despite the crucial role of the {5'UTR} in translation initiation, very little is known about whether {m(6)A} modification influences {mRNA} translation. Here we show that in response to heat shock stress, certain adenosines within the {5'UTR} of newly transcribed {mRNAs} are preferentially methylated. We find that the dynamic {5'UTR} methylation is a result of stress-induced nuclear localization of {YTHDF2,} a well-characterized {m(6)A} 'reader'. Upon heat shock stress, the nuclear {YTHDF2} preserves {5'UTR} methylation of stress-induced transcripts by limiting the {m(6)A} 'eraser' {FTO} from demethylation. Remarkably, the increased {5'UTR} methylation in the form of {m(6)A} promotes cap-independent translation initiation, providing a mechanism for selective {mRNA} translation under heat shock stress. Using Hsp70 {mRNA} as an example, we demonstrate that a single {m(6)A} modification site in the {5'UTR} enables translation initiation independent of the 5' end N(7)-methylguanosine cap. The elucidation of the dynamic features of {5'UTR} methylation and its critical role in cap-independent translation not only expands the breadth of physiological roles of {m(6)A,} but also uncovers a previously unappreciated translational control mechanism in heat shock response.},

  abstract={Identification of candidate causal variants in regions associated with risk of common diseases is complicated by linkage disequilibrium {(LD)} and multiple association signals. Nonetheless, accurate maps of these variants are needed, both to fully exploit detailed cell specific chromatin annotation data to highlight disease causal mechanisms and cells, and for design of the functional studies that will ultimately be required to confirm causal mechanisms. We adapted a Bayesian evolutionary stochastic search algorithm to the fine mapping problem, and demonstrated its improved performance over conventional stepwise and regularised regression through simulation studies. We then applied it to fine map the established multiple sclerosis {(MS)} and type 1 diabetes {(T1D)} associations in the {IL-2RA} {(CD25)} gene region. For {T1D,} both stepwise and stochastic search approaches identified four {T1D} association signals, with the major effect tagged by the single nucleotide polymorphism, rs12722496. In contrast, for {MS,} the stochastic search found two distinct competing models: a single candidate causal variant, tagged by rs2104286 and reported previously using stepwise analysis; and a more complex model with two association signals, one of which was tagged by the major {T1D} associated rs12722496 and the other by rs56382813. There is low to moderate {LD} between rs2104286 and both rs12722496 and rs56382813 (r2 \&\#x2243; 0:3) and our two {SNP} model could not be recovered through a forward stepwise search after conditioning on rs2104286. Both signals in the two variant model for {MS} affect {CD25} expression on distinct subpopulations of {CD4+} T cells, which are key cells in the autoimmune process. The results support a shared causal variant for {T1D} and {MS.} Our study illustrates the benefit of using a purposely designed model search strategy for fine mapping and the advantage of combining disease and protein expression data.},

  abstract={{DNA} methylation undergoes dynamic changes during development and cell differentiation. Recent genome-wide studies discovered that tissue-specific differentially methylated regions {(DMRs)} often overlap tissue-specific distal cis-regulatory elements. However, developmental {DNA} methylation dynamics of the majority of the genomic {CpGs} outside gene promoters and {CpG} islands has not been extensively characterized. Here, we generate and compare comprehensive {DNA} methylome maps of zebrafish developing embryos. From these maps, we identify thousands of developmental stage-specific {DMRs} {(dsDMRs)} across zebrafish developmental stages. The {dsDMRs} contain evolutionarily conserved sequences, are associated with developmental genes and are marked with active enhancer histone posttranslational modifications. Their methylation pattern correlates much stronger than promoter methylation with expression of putative target genes. When tested in vivo using a transgenic zebrafish assay, 20 out of 20 selected candidate {dsDMRs} exhibit functional enhancer activities. Our data suggest that developmental enhancers are a major target of {DNA} methylation changes during embryogenesis.},

Which cell type represents the primary source of {IL-17} in {PsO} and {PsA?} And how are these cells regulated? This review outlines the {IL-17} pathway, summarises the evidence supporting its role in {PsO} and {PsA} and discusses recent data that may help to address these yet unresolved questions.},

  abstract={The skin represents the primary interface between the host and the environment. This organ is also home to trillions of microorganisms that play an important role in tissue homeostasis and local immunity. Skin microbial communities are highly diverse and can be remodelled over time or in response to environmental challenges. How, in the context of this complexity, individual commensal microorganisms may differentially modulate skin immunity and the consequences of these responses for tissue physiology remains unclear. Here we show that defined commensals dominantly affect skin immunity and identify the cellular mediators involved in this specification. In particular, colonization with Staphylococcus epidermidis induces {IL-17A(+)} {CD8(+)} T cells that home to the epidermis, enhance innate barrier immunity and limit pathogen invasion. Commensal-specific T-cell responses result from the coordinated action of skin-resident dendritic cell subsets and are not associated with inflammation, revealing that tissue-resident cells are poised to sense and respond to alterations in microbial communities. This interaction may represent an evolutionary means by which the skin immune system uses fluctuating commensal signals to calibrate barrier immunity and provide heterologous protection against invasive pathogens. These findings reveal that the skin immune landscape is a highly dynamic environment that can be rapidly and specifically remodelled by encounters with defined commensals, findings that have profound implications for our understanding of tissue-specific immunity and pathologies.},

As a result, most transcriptome studies of autoimmune disease have only assessed protein-coding transcripts. Results We used {RNA-seq} data from 99 lesional psoriatic, 27 uninvolved psoriatic, and 90 normal skin biopsies, and applied computational approaches to identify and characterize expressed {lncRNAs.} We detect 2,942 previously annotated and 1,080 novel {lncRNAs} which are expected to be skin specific. Notably, over 40\% of the novel {lncRNAs} are differentially expressed and the proportions of differentially expressed transcripts among protein-coding {mRNAs} and previously-annotated {lncRNAs} are lower in psoriasis lesions versus uninvolved or normal skin. We find that many {lncRNAs,} in particular those that are differentially expressed, are co-expressed with genes involved in immune related functions, and that novel {lncRNAs} are enriched for localization in the epidermal differentiation complex. We also identify distinct tissue-specific expression patterns and epigenetic profiles for novel {lncRNAs,} some of which are shown to be regulated by cytokine treatment in cultured human keratinocytes. Conclusions Together, our results implicate many {lncRNAs} in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis, and our results provide a resource for {lncRNA} studies in other autoimmune diseases.},

Although all immune cells are affected during aging, the functional capacity of T cells is most influenced and is linked to decreased responsiveness to infections and impaired differentiation.

The majority of age-related hypermethylated sites were located at {CpG} islands of silent genes and enriched for repressive histone marks. Specifically, in {CD8+} T cell subset we identified strong inverse correlation between methylation and expression levels in genes associated with T cell mediated immune response {(LGALS1,} {IFNG,} {CCL5,} {GZMH,} {CCR7,} {CD27} and {CD248)} and differentiation {(SATB1,} {TCF7,} {BCL11B} and {RUNX3).} Our results thus suggest the link between age-related epigenetic changes and impaired T cell function.},

  abstract={Genome-wide association studies {(GWAS)} are able to identify the role of individual {SNPs} in influencing a phenotype. Nevertheless, such analysis is unable to explain the biological complexity of several diseases. We elaborated an algorithm that starting from genes in molecular pathways implicated in a phenotype is able to identify {SNP–SNP} interaction’s role in association with the phenotype. The algorithm is based on three steps. Firstly, it identifies the biological pathways (gene ontology) in which the genes under analysis play a role {(GeneMANIA).} Secondly, it identifies the group of {SNPs} that best fits the phenotype (and covariates) under analysis, not considering individual {SNP} regression coefficients but fitting the regression for the group itself. Finally, it operates an analysis of {SNP} interactions for each possible couple of {SNPs} within the group. The sensitivity and specificity of our algorithm was validated in simulated datasets {(HapGen} and Simulate Phenotypes programs). The impact on efficiency deriving from changes in the number of {SNPs/patients} under analysis, linkage disequilibrium and minor allele frequency thresholds was analyzed. Our algorithm showed a strong stability throughout all analysis operated, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 81.67~\% and a specificity of 98.35~\%. We elaborated a stable algorithm that may detect {SNPs} interactions, especially those effects that pass undetected in classical {GWAS.} This method may contribute to face the two relevant limitations of {GWAS:} lack of biological informative power and amount of time needed for the analysis.},

  abstract={Over recent years, significant progress has been made in characterisation of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in psoriasis, a common cutaneous disease that is associated with major systemic co-morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Basic science discoveries have informed the design of novel therapeutic approaches, many of which are now under evaluation in late-stage clinical trials. Here we describe the complex interplay between immune cell types and cytokine networks that acts within self-perpetuating feedback loops to drive cutaneous inflammation in psoriasis. Genetic studies have been pivotal in the construction of the disease model and more recently have uncovered a distinct aetiology for rare, pustular variants of psoriasis. The translation of mechanistic insights into potential advancements in clinical care will also be described, including several treatments that target the interleukin-23 {(IL-23)/T17} immune axis.},

  abstract={Genetic variation associated with disease often appears in non-coding parts of the genome. Understanding the mechanisms by which this phenomenon leads to disease is necessary to translate results from genetic association studies to the clinic. Assigning function to this type of variation is notoriously difficult because the human genome harbours a complex regulatory landscape with a dizzying array of transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as enhancers that have unpredictable, promiscuous and context-dependent behaviour. In this Review, we discuss how technological advances have provided increasingly detailed information on genome folding; for example, genome folding forms loops that bring enhancers and target genes into close proximity. We also now know that enhancers function within topologically associated domains, which are structural and functional units of chromosomes. Studying disease-associated mutations and chromosomal rearrangements in the context of the {3D} genome will enable the identification of dysregulated target genes and aid the progression from descriptive genetic association results to discovering molecular mechanisms underlying disease.},

  abstract={Neutrophil extracellular traps {(NETs)} have been implicated in the development of certain immune-mediated diseases, but their role in psoriasis has not been clearly defined. Human β-defensin-2 {(HBD-2)} is an important antimicrobial peptide overexpressed in psoriasis epidermis. We evaluated whether the amount of {NETs} is increased in psoriasis and determined the effect of {NETs} on {HBD-2} production in epidermal keratinocytes. Using fluorescent microscopy, we found that patients with psoriasis (n = 48) had higher amount of {NETotic} cells in their peripheral blood compared to healthy controls (n = 48) and patients with eczema (n = 35). Psoriasis sera showed increased ability to induce {NET} formation in control neutrophils but normal {NET} degradation ability. The amount of {NETs} in the peripheral blood correlated with psoriasis disease severity. {NETosis} was also observed in the majority (18 of 20) of psoriasis skin specimens. Furthermore, {NETs} induced {HBD-2} {mRNA} and protein production in keratinocytes, and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed strong expression of {HBD-2} in psoriasis lesional skin. In summary, {NET} formation is increased in peripheral blood and lesional skin of psoriasis patients and correlates with disease severity. Additionally, {NET-induced} {HBD-2} production may provide a novel mechanism for the decreased susceptibility of psoriasis plaques to microbial infections.},

  abstract={Heterogeneity of T cells is a hallmark of a successful adaptive immune response, harnessing the vast diversity of antigen-specific T cells into a coordinated evolution of effector and memory outcomes. The T cell receptor {(TCR)} repertoire is highly diverse to account for the highly heterogeneous antigenic world. During the response to a virus multiple individual clones of antigen specific {CD8+} {(Ag-specific)} T cells can be identified against a single epitope and multiple epitopes are recognised. Advances in single-cell technologies have provided the potential to study Ag-specific T cell heterogeneity at both surface phenotype and transcriptome levels, thereby allowing investigation of the diversity within the same apparent sub-population. We propose a new method {(VDJPuzzle)} to reconstruct the native {TCRαβ} from single cell {RNA-seq} data of Ag-specific T cells and then to link these with the gene expression profile of individual cells. We applied this method using rare Ag-specific T cells isolated from peripheral blood of a subject who cleared hepatitis C virus infection. We successfully reconstructed productive {TCRαβ} in 56 of a total of 63 cells (89\%), with double α and double β in 18, and 7\% respectively, and double {TCRαβ} in 2 cells. The method was validated via standard single cell {PCR} sequencing of the {TCR.} We demonstrate that single-cell transcriptome analysis can successfully distinguish Ag-specific T cell populations sorted directly from resting memory cells in peripheral blood and sorted after ex vivo stimulation. This approach allows a detailed analysis of the {TCR} diversity and its relationship with the transcriptional profile of different clones.},

  abstract={Three-dimensional genome structure plays an important role in gene regulation. Globally, chromosomes are organized into active and inactive compartments while, at the gene level, looping interactions connect promoters to regulatory elements. Topologically associating domains {(TADs),} typically several hundred kilobases in size, form an intermediate level of organization. Major questions include how {TADs} are formed and how they are related to looping interactions between genes and regulatory elements. Here we performed a focused {5C} analysis of a 2.8 Mb chromosome 7 region surrounding {CFTR} in a panel of cell types. We find that the same {TAD} boundaries are present in all cell types, indicating that {TADs} represent a universal chromosome architecture. Furthermore, we find that these {TAD} boundaries are present irrespective of the expression and looping of genes located between them. In contrast, looping interactions between promoters and regulatory elements are cell-type specific and occur mostly within {TADs.} This is exemplified by the {CFTR} promoter that in different cell types interacts with distinct sets of distal cell-type-specific regulatory elements that are all located within the same {TAD.} Finally, we find that long-range associations between loci located in different {TADs} are also detected, but these display much lower interaction frequencies than looping interactions within {TADs.} Interestingly, interactions between {TADs} are also highly cell-type-specific and often involve loci clustered around {TAD} boundaries. These data point to key roles of invariant {TAD} boundaries in constraining as well as mediating cell-type-specific long-range interactions and gene regulation. },

  abstract={Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a complex genetic architecture. To date, the psoriasis heritability is only partially explained. However, there is increasing evidence that the missing heritability in psoriasis could be explained by multiple genetic variants of low effect size from common genetic pathways. The objective of this study was to identify new genetic variation associated with psoriasis risk at the pathway level. We genotyped 598,258 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a discovery cohort of 2,281 case-control individuals from Spain. We performed a genome-wide pathway analysis using 1,053 reference biological pathways. A total of 14 genetic pathways {(PFDR} \&\#x2264; 2.55 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-2)) were found to be significantly associated with psoriasis risk. Using an independent validation cohort of 7,353 individuals from the {UK,} a total of 6 genetic pathways were significantly replicated {(PFDR} \&\#x2264; 3.46 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-2)). We found genetic pathways that had not been previously associated with psoriasis risk such as retinol metabolism {(Pcombined\&\#xA0;=} 1.84 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-4)), the transport of inorganic ions and amino acids {(Pcombined\&\#xA0;=} 1.57 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-7)), and post-translational protein modification {(Pcombined\&\#xA0;=} 1.57 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-7)). In the latter pathway, {MGAT5} showed a strong network centrality, and its association with psoriasis risk was further validated in an additional case-control cohort of 3,429 individuals {(P} \&lt; 0.05).

Yet how they control gene expression in single cells, quantitatively and over time, remains unclear. We used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the dynamic effects of four silencers associated with diverse modifications: {DNA} methylation, histone deacetylation, and histone methylation. For all regulators, silencing and reactivation occurred in all-or-none events, enabling the regulators to modulate the fraction of cells silenced rather than the amount of gene expression. These dynamics could be described by a three-state model involving stochastic transitions between active, reversibly silent, and irreversibly silent states. Through their individual transition rates, these regulators operate over different time scales and generate distinct types of epigenetic memory. Our results provide a framework for understanding and engineering mammalian chromatin regulation and epigenetic memory.},

Therefore, studies on spatial interactions between chromatin have created a new avenue for elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation in disease pathogenesis. Recently, a growing number of chromatin interactions have been revealed by means of {3C,} {4C,} {5C,} {ChIA-PET} and {Hi-C} technologies. To interpret and utilize these interactions, we constructed chromatin–chromatin spatial interaction {(CCSI)} database by integrating and annotating 91 sets of chromatin interaction data derived from published literature, {UCSC} database and {NCBI} {GEO} database, resulting in a total of 3 017 962 pairwise interactions (false discovery rate \{\textless\} 0.05), covering human, mouse and yeast. A web interface has been designed to provide access to the chromatin interactions. The main features of {CCSI} are (i) showing chromatin interactions and corresponding genes, enhancers and {SNPs} within the regions in the search page; (ii) offering complete interaction datasets, enhancer and {SNP} information in the download page; and (iii) providing analysis pipeline for the annotation of interaction data. In conclusion, {CCSI} will facilitate exploring transcriptional regulatory mechanism in disease pathogenesis associated with spatial interactions among genes, regulatory regions and {SNPs.} Database {URL:http://songyanglab.sysu.edu.cn/ccsi}},

  abstract={Biobanking is a widespread practice for storing biological samples for future studies ranging from genotyping to {RNA} analysis. However, methods that probe the status of the epigenome are lacking. Here, the framework for applying the Assay for Transposase Accessible Sequencing {(ATAC-seq)} to biobanked specimens is described and was used to examine the accessibility landscape of {na\&\#xEF;ve} B cells from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus {(SLE)} patients undergoing disease flares. An {SLE} specific chromatin accessibility signature was identified. Changes in accessibility occurred at loci surrounding genes involved in B cell activation and contained motifs for transcription factors that regulate B cell activation and differentiation. These data provide evidence for an altered epigenetic programming in {SLE} B cells and identify loci and transcription factor networks that potentially impact disease. The ability to determine the chromatin accessibility landscape and identify cis-regulatory elements has broad application to studies using biorepositories and offers significant advantages to improve the molecular information obtained from biobanked samples.},

Using high-density genotype data from more than 86,000 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 244 independent multidisease signals, including 27 new genome-wide significant susceptibility loci and 3 unreported shared risk loci. Complex pleiotropy was supported when contrasting multidisease signals with expression data sets from human, rat and mouse together with epigenetic and expressed enhancer profiles. The comorbidities among the five immune diseases were best explained by biological pleiotropy rather than heterogeneity (a subgroup of cases genetically identical to those with another disease, possibly owing to diagnostic misclassification, molecular subtypes or excessive comorbidity). In particular, the strong comorbidity between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease is likely the result of a unique disease, which is genetically distinct from classical inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes.},

Requiring few types of input data, we are able to apply our method to reconstruct the enhancer-target networks in 935 samples of human primary cells, tissues and cell lines, which constitute by far the largest set of enhancer-target networks. The similarity of these networks from different samples closely follows their cell and tissue lineages. We discover three major co-regulation modes of enhancers and find defense-related genes often simultaneously regulated by multiple enhancers bound by different transcription factors.

  abstract={Recent evidence suggests that a substantial portion of complex disease risk alleles modify gene expression in a cell-specific manner. To identify candidate causal genes and biological pathways of immune-related complex diseases, we conducted expression quantitative trait loci {(eQTL)} analysis on five subsets of immune cells {(CD4(+)} T cells, {CD8(+)} T cells, B cells, natural killer {(NK)} cells and monocytes) and unfractionated peripheral blood from 105 healthy Japanese volunteers. We developed a three-step analytical pipeline comprising (i) prediction of individual gene expression using our {eQTL} database and public epigenomic data, (ii) gene-level association analysis and (iii) prediction of cell-specific pathway activity by integrating the direction of {eQTL} effects. By applying this pipeline to rheumatoid arthritis data sets, we identified candidate causal genes and a cytokine pathway (upregulation of tumor necrosis factor {(TNF)} in {CD4(+)} T cells). Our approach is an efficient way to characterize the polygenic contributions and potential biological mechanisms of complex diseases.},

  abstract={The T-cell receptor {(TCR),} located on the surface of T cells, is responsible for the recognition of the antigen-major histocompatibility complex, leading to the initiation of an inflammatory response. Analysing the {TCR} repertoire may help to gain a better understanding of the immune system features and of the aetiology and progression of diseases, in particular those with unknown antigenic triggers. The extreme diversity of the {TCR} repertoire represents a major analytical challenge; this has led to the development of specialized methods which aim to characterize the {TCR} repertoire in-depth. Currently, next generation sequencing based technologies are most widely employed for the high-throughput analysis of the immune cell repertoire. Here, we report on the latest methodological advancements in the field by describing and comparing the available tools; from the choice of the starting material and library preparation method, to the sequencing technologies and data analysis. Finally, we provide a practical example and our own experience by reporting some exemplary results from a small internal benchmark study, where current approaches from the literature and the market are employed and compared. Several valid methods for clonotype identification and {TCR} repertoire analysis exist, however, a gold standard method for the field has not yet been identified. Depending on the purpose of the scientific study, some approaches may be more suitable than others. Finally, due to possible method specific biases, scientists must be careful when comparing results obtained using different methods.},

However, because causal variants are difficult to identify, and {cis-eQTLs} occur frequently, it remains challenging to identify specific instances of disease-relevant changes to gene regulation. Here, we used a novel joint likelihood framework with higher resolution than that of previous methods to identify loci where autoimmune-disease risk and an {eQTL} are driven by a single shared genetic effect. Using {eQTLs} from three major immune subpopulations, we found shared effects in only {\&\#x223C;25\%} of the loci examined. Thus, we show that a fraction of gene-regulatory changes suggest strong mechanistic hypotheses for disease risk, but we conclude that most risk mechanisms are not likely to involve changes in basal gene expression.},

  abstract={Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci, but few have been conclusively resolved to specific functional variants. Here we report fine-mapping of 94 inflammatory bowel disease loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. We pinpoint 18 associations to a single causal variant with greater than 95\% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with greater than 50\% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for protein-coding changes (n\&\#x2009;=\&\#x2009;13), direct disruption of transcription-factor binding sites (n\&\#x2009;=\&\#x2009;3), and tissue-specific epigenetic marks (n\&\#x2009;=\&\#x2009;10), with the last category showing enrichment in specific immune cells among associations stronger in Crohn's disease and in gut mucosa among associations stronger in ulcerative colitis. The results of this study suggest that high-resolution fine-mapping in large samples can convert many discoveries from genome-wide association studies into statistically convincing causal variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental elucidation of disease mechanisms.},

  abstract={Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin that is sometimes accompanied by an auto-inflammatory arthritis called psoriatic arthritis {(PsA).} Psoriasis and {PsA} are multifactorial diseases that result from complex interactions of environmental and genetic risk factors. Epigenetic marks, which are labile chemical marks with diverse functions, form a layer of biological information that sits at the interface of genetics and the environment. Aberrant epigenetic regulation has been previously implicated in other rheumatological disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the nascent literature on epigenetics in psoriasis and {PsA.} A systematic review yielded 52 primary articles after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted using a standardized template and study quality assessed using a methodological quality checklist. Studies reflect a broad range of epigenetic sub-disciplines, the most common being {DNA} methylation, followed by the parent of origin effect or genomic imprinting, expression or activity of epigenetic modifying enzymes, and histone modifications. Epidemiological studies demonstrating excessive paternal transmission provided the earliest evidence of epigenetic deregulation in psoriatic disease, however few studies have examined its molecular mechanisms. Methylation studies evolved rapidly from low resolution global to targeted analyses of known psoriatic disease susceptibility loci such as {HLA-C*0602.} The recent explosion of epigenome-wide association studies has provided us with novel insights into psoriasis pathogenesis, and the mechanism of action of {UVB,} methotrexate, and {anti-TNF} therapies, as well as molecular signatures of psoriasis that may have clinical relevance. Finally, recent studies of pharmacological inhibitors of epigenetic modifier enzymes demonstrate their potential applicability as novel treatment modalities for psoriasis. Challenges of epigenetics research in psoriasis and {PsA} were identified and future perspectives are discussed herein.},

  abstract={Most disease-associated genetic variants are noncoding, making it challenging to design experiments to understand their functional consequences. Identification of expression quantitative trait loci {(eQTLs)} has been a powerful approach to infer the downstream effects of disease-associated variants, but most of these variants remain unexplained. The analysis of {DNA} methylation, a key component of the epigenome, offers highly complementary data on the regulatory potential of genomic regions. Here we show that disease-associated variants have widespread effects on {DNA} methylation in trans that likely reflect differential occupancy of trans binding sites by cis-regulated transcription factors. Using multiple omics data sets from 3,841 Dutch individuals, we identified 1,907 established trait-associated {SNPs} that affect the methylation levels of 10,141 different {CpG} sites in trans (false discovery rate {(FDR)} \&lt; 0.05). These included {SNPs} that affect both the expression of a nearby transcription factor (such as {NFKB1,} {CTCF} and {NKX2-3)} and methylation of its respective binding site across the genome. Trans methylation {QTLs} effectively expose the downstream effects of disease-associated variants.},

  abstract={The {CRISPR/Cas9} system is a prevalent and versatile genome-editing tool of choice for basic and applied biological research. An exchange of a 20-bp spacer sequence in the {gRNA} can easily reprogram Cas9 to target a different {DNA} site. By expressing or providing multiple {gRNAs,} the system also enables multiplex genome editing at high efficiencies. Current approaches for providing multiple {gRNAs} in vivo include the use of multigene cassettes to express several {gRNAs,} Csy4-based excision, arrays of {crRNAs,} ribozyme-flanked {gRNAs,} {tRNA-dependent} cleavage of {gRNAs,} and direct introduction of Cas9 proteins preloaded with different {gRNAs.} By simultaneously targeting multiple {DNA} sequences, multiplex genome editing can be used to knockout multiple genes or delete chromosomal fragments. Off-target risk can also be reduced by Cas9-dimers that require the simultaneous expression of two {gRNAs.} With multiple {gRNAs,} specific gene expression or methylation status can be efficiently controlled by {dCas9} fused to activators, repressors, methyltransferase, demethylase, or other functional domains. As a result, multiplex genome editing is expected to accelerate functional discovery of plant genes as well as genetic improvement of agricultural crops.},

  abstract={Genome-wide association studies have identified loci underlying human diseases, but the causal nucleotide changes and mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we developed a fine-mapping algorithm to identify candidate causal variants for 21 autoimmune diseases from genotyping data. We integrated these predictions with transcription and cis-regulatory element annotations, derived by mapping {RNA} and chromatin in primary immune cells, including resting and stimulated {CD4+} T-cell subsets, regulatory T cells, {CD8+} T cells, B cells, and monocytes. We find that \{\textasciitilde\}90\% of causal variants are non-coding, with \{\textasciitilde\}60\% mapping to immune-cell enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer-associated {RNA} upon immune stimulation. Causal variants tend to occur near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10–20\% directly alter recognizable transcription factor binding motifs. Rather, most non-coding risk variants, including those that alter gene expression, affect non-canonical sequence determinants not well-explained by current gene regulatory models.},
