We examine the functional outcome of 39 variants associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus {(SLE)} through the integration of {GWAS} and {eQTL} data from the {TwinsUK} microarray and {RNA-Seq} cohort in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We use conditional analysis and a Bayesian colocalisation method to provide evidence of a shared causal-variant, then compare the ability of each quantification type to detect disease relevant {eQTLs} and {eGenes.} We discovered the greatest frequency of candidate-causal {eQTLs} using exon-level {RNA-Seq,} and identified novel {SLE} susceptibility genes (e.g. {NADSYN1} and {TCF7)} that were concealed using microarrays, including four non-coding {RNAs.} Many of these {eQTLs} were found to influence the expression of several genes, supporting the notion that risk haplotypes may harbour multiple functional effects. Novel {SLE} associated splicing events were identified in the T-reg restricted transcription factor, {IKZF2,} and other candidate genes (e.g. {WDFY4)} through {asQTL} mapping using the Geuvadis cohort. We have significantly increased our understanding of the genetic control of gene-expression in {SLE} by maximising the leverage of {RNA-Seq} and performing integrative {GWAS-eQTL} analysis against gene, exon, and splice-junction quantifications. We conclude that to better understand the true functional consequence of regulatory variants, quantification by {RNA-Seq} should be performed at the exon-level as a minimum, and run in parallel with gene and splice-junction level quantification.},

Nucleosomal arrays are the fundamental building block of chromosomal superstructures, the substrate for transcription, and the first nucleoprotein assembly laid down after {DNA} replication. The development of homogeneous length-defined nucleosomal arrays has led to a greatly improved understanding of nucleosomal array structural dynamics in the solution state. Under physiological salt conditions, a nucleosomal array is in dynamic equilibrium between folded, self-associated and dissociated conformational states. Folding and self-association are both critically dependent on the core histone tail domains, consistent with an essential functional role for the tail domains in the mediation of chromosomal level {DNA} compaction in the nucleus. Nucleosomal array folding is repressive in transcription in vitro, but can be overcome by compositional (e.g., tail domain acetylation) and configurational (e.g., histone octamer depletion) changes that are correlated with transcriptional activation in vivo. The mechanism of replication-coupled chromatin assembly also appears to be functionally linked to the dynamic properties of nucleosomal arrays. Although once thought to be both structurally and functionally inert, it is now apparent that the nucleosomal array is a key participant in the biological processes that take place within the chromosomal fibers of eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of chromatin fiber structure across the human genome. Compact and open chromatin fiber structures were separated by sucrose sedimentation and their distributions analyzed by hybridization to metaphase chromosomes and genomic microarrays. We show that compact chromatin fibers originate from some sites of heterochromatin {(C-bands),} and G-bands (euchromatin). Open chromatin fibers correlate with regions of highest gene density, but not with gene expression since inactive genes can be in domains of open chromatin, and active genes in regions of low gene density can be embedded in compact chromatin fibers. Moreover, we show that chromatin fiber structure impacts on further levels of chromatin condensation. Regions of open chromatin fibers are cytologically decondensed and have a distinctive nuclear organization. We suggest that domains of open chromatin may create an environment that facilitates transcriptional activation and could provide an evolutionary constraint to maintain clusters of genes together along chromosomes.},

It mediates these effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor {(VDR),} which belongs to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptors. As a result of keratinocyte differentiation and anti-proliferation activities, {1,25(OH)(2)D(3)} and its synthetic analogs are therapeutically effective in psoriasis and show promise for the treatment of actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma. To elucidate the {VDR} signaling pathway in keratinocytes, we examined the gene expression profile with {1,25(OH)(2)D(3)} treatment using oligonucleotide microarrays. Out of the 12,600 genes investigated, 82 were upregulated and 16 were downregulated and many of these were involved in differentiation, proliferation, and immune response. We have identified three vitamin D-responsive chromosomal loci (1p36, 19q13, and 6p25) and show the induction of various class {II} tumor suppressor/growth-regulatory genes in response to {1,25(OH)(2)D(3).} Finally, quantitative differences in gene expression revealed a vitamin D-regulated differentiation network and identified peptidylarginine deiminases, kallikreins, serine proteinase inhibitor family members, Kruppel-like factor 4, and c-fos as vitamin D-responsive genes, whose protein products may play an important role in epidermal differentiation in normal and diseased state.},

Although their biological importance has become clear, how they recognize and regulate target genes remains less well understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the minimal requirements for functional {miRNA-target} duplexes in vivo and distinguish classes of target sites with different functional properties. Target sites can be grouped into two broad categories. 5' dominant sites have sufficient complementarity to the {miRNA} 5' end to function with little or no support from pairing to the {miRNA} 3' end. Indeed, sites with 3' pairing below the random noise level are functional given a strong 5' end. In contrast, 3' compensatory sites have insufficient 5' pairing and require strong 3' pairing for function. We present examples and genome-wide statistical support to show that both classes of sites are used in biologically relevant genes. We provide evidence that an average {miRNA} has approximately 100 target sites, indicating that {miRNAs} regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes and that {miRNA} 3' ends are key determinants of target specificity within {miRNA} families.},

That is, many genetic and nongenetic factors interact to determine the final phenotype, whether that phenotype is susceptibility to disease, or a quantifiable trait such as height, weight, serum cholesterol, or blood pressure. Identifying the genes that underlie the population variation in these phenotypes has been challenging. Recently, databases of common genetic variants, recognition of the patterns of genetic variation, and rapid genotyping methodologies have emerged, and the combination of these tools and resources will greatly facilitate genetic association studies, a potentially powerful method to map the genes for complex traits. However, care will be required in performing and interpreting these association studies. Until genome-wide studies are feasible, choosing candidate genes will be necessary. In addition, the choice of phenotype will likely influence the success of these gene mapping efforts. Finally, population genetic methods, including searching for genes under selection, may provide clues to the location of the genes for common disease and complex traits.},

We determined several factors which do not affect cell viability after cryopreservation such as shipping frozen samples on dry ice, the length of time and speed at which samples are washed and centrifuged after thawing, and the number of cells frozen per container. Different media additives, however, did impact the viability of the cells after thawing. There was a significant reduction in the viability of the cells after freezing when using human {AB} serum compared to all other additives tested (p\{\textless\}0.000). A second critical parameter was the temperature of the media used to wash the cells after removal from the cryotubes. When the media was cooled to 4 {{\textdegree}C} prior to washing, the mean viability was 69.7{\textpm}12.5\%, at 25 {{\textdegree}C} 92.55{\textpm}3.1\%, and at 37 {{\textdegree}C} 95.11{\textpm}2.5\%.

Tape-harvested epidermis was extracted for {RNA,} which was profiled by semiquantitative reverse {transcriptase-PCR.} This analysis revealed that {mRNAs} for tumor necrosis factor alpha, {IFNgamma,} Krt-16, {CD2,} {IL-23A,} {IL-12B,} and vascular endothelial growth factor are overexpressed in the "average" psoriatic lesion in a majority of patients. In addition, 10 of these patients were biopsied at lesional and non-lesional sites and the expression data compared to tape-stripping data. This comparison shows that five of seven {mRNA} are more highly expressed in cells captured by tape stripping than biopsy, suggesting that the upper aspect of a lesion contains cells very active in the disease. The tape-harvesting data reveal that approximately 46\% of lesions have at least one pathogenic {mRNA} within non-lesional skin limits. Data demonstrate that tape stripping reveals {mRNA} markers not detected in biopsy samples and thus the method may be a useful supplement to biopsy.},

Based on recent data from humans and animal models, we propose that a psoriasis lesion can be triggered and sustained by the local network of skin-resident immune cells.

Genetic analyses have repeatedly identified a primary disease susceptibility locus lying within the major histocompatibility complex {(MHC),} on chromosome 6p21. A small number of {non-MHC} susceptibility loci have also been identified. These regions tend to overlap with susceptibility intervals for Crohn's disease and atopic dermatitis, suggesting the possibility that genetic variants affecting inflammatory pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple disorders. Here, we report a genetic analysis of the interleukin 23 receptor gene {(IL23R),} which was recently identified as a susceptibility determinant for Crohn's disease. We initially examined the results of a whole-genome association scan, carried out on 318 cases and 288 controls. We observed a significant increase of a non-synonymous substitution {(p.Arg381Gln)} among controls {(P} = 0.00036). We validated this finding by extending our cohort to include a further 519 cases and 528 controls. In the overall sample, the frequency of the {381Gln} allele was 3.6\% in cases and 7\% in controls, yielding a P value of 0.00014. Next, we examined genetic variation at the {IL12RB1,} {IL23A} and {IL12B} genes, respectively, encoding the second subunit of the {IL23R} receptor and the two subunits of its ligand. This analysis identified independent associations for {IL12B} {SNPs} rs10045431 {(P} value for the extended dataset = 0.0001) and rs3212227 {(P} = 0.036).

Evidence that this disease is distinct from rheumatoid arthritis and other spondyloarthropathies is based on data derived from characteristic clinical features, histopathologic analyses, immunogenetic associations and musculoskeletal imaging. Emphasis has centered previously on a dominant role for the T lymphocyte in the inflammatory process; however, studies provide support for a major contribution from monocyte-macrophages in the initiation and perpetuation of joint and skin inflammation. The occurrence of arthritis in the absence of psoriasis in a minority of patients with psoriatic arthritis, coupled with divergent genetic risk factors, indicates that psoriatic arthritis is distinct from psoriatic skin inflammation. A new terminology, psoriatic disease, has emerged that encompasses the various manifestations of tissue and organ involvement observed in many psoriasis patients, including inflammation in the joint, eye and gut. Moreover, adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes in patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis might be directly linked to the cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations of these diseases via subsets of circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages activated by inflammatory cytokine networks that arise in the skin and possibly the joint.},

Here we show for the first time that psoriasis-affected skin has a specific {microRNA} expression profile when compared with healthy human skin or with another chronic inflammatory skin disease, atopic eczema. Among the psoriasis-specific {microRNAs,} we identified leukocyte-derived {microRNAs} and one keratinocyte-derived {microRNA,} {miR-203.} In a panel of 21 different human organs and tissues, {miR-203} showed a highly skin-specific expression profile. Among the cellular constituents of the skin, it was exclusively expressed by keratinocytes. The up-regulation of {miR-203} in psoriatic plaques was concurrent with the down-regulation of an evolutionary conserved target of {miR-203,} suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 {(SOCS-3),} which is involved in inflammatory responses and keratinocyte functions. Our results suggest that {microRNA} deregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and contributes to the dysfunction of the cross talk between resident and infiltrating cells. Taken together, a new layer of regulatory mechanisms is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases.},

When early differentiation was assessed, {VN} but not {FN} decreased cytoplasmic tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity and pre-osteoclast number at 48\&\#x2009;h. {OPN} had the opposite effect to {FN} on osteoclast formation. When {RAW} cells were differentiated on {OPN} and treated by {FN} and {OPN,} osteoclast number only in the {FN} treated group was 40-60\% lower than the control, while the total number of nuclei was unchanged, suggesting that {FN} delays osteoclast fusion. In contrast to its inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis, {FN} increased resorption by increasing both osteoclast activity and the percentage of resorbing osteoclasts. This was accompanied by an increase in nitric oxide {(NO)} levels and {interleukin-1\&\#x3B2;} {(IL-1\&\#x3B2;).} {IL-1\&\#x3B2;} production was inhibited using the {NO-synthase} inhibitor only on {FN} indicating a {FN-specific} cross-talk between {NO} and {IL-1\&\#x3B2;} signaling pathways.

Although individual modifications have been linked to the activity levels of various genetic functional elements, their combinatorial patterns are still unresolved and their potential for systematic de novo genome annotation remains untapped. Here, we use a multivariate Hidden Markov Model to reveal 'chromatin states' in human T cells, based on recurrent and spatially coherent combinations of chromatin marks. We define 51 distinct chromatin states, including promoter-associated, transcription-associated, active intergenic, large-scale repressed and repeat-associated states. Each chromatin state shows specific enrichments in functional annotations, sequence motifs and specific experimentally observed characteristics, suggesting distinct biological roles. This approach provides a complementary functional annotation of the human genome that reveals the genome-wide locations of diverse classes of epigenetic function.},

Ten {CTCF} sites that divide the {MHC-II} locus into apparent evolutionary domains were identified. To define the role of {CTCF} in mediating regulation of the {MHC} {II} genes, chromatin conformation capture assays, which provide an architectural assessment of a locus, were conducted across the {MHC-II} region. Depending on whether {MHC-II} genes and the class {II} transactivator {(CIITA)} were being expressed, two {CTCF-dependent} chromatin architectural states, each with multiple configurations and interactions, were observed. These states included the ability to express {MHC-II} gene promoter regions to interact with nearby {CTCF} sites and {CTCF} sites to interact with each other. Thus, {CTCF} organizes the {MHC-II} locus into a novel basal architecture of interacting foci and loop structures that rearranges in the presence of {CIITA.} Disruption of the rearranged states eradicated expression, suggesting that the formation of these structures is key to coregulation of {MHC-II} genes and the locus.},

This study demonstrates that {microRNA-19} {(miR-19)} regulates tissue factor expression in breast cancer cells, providing a molecular basis for the selective expression of the tissue factor gene. Tissue factor protein was barely detectable in {MCF-7,} {T47D,} and {ZR-75-1} cells (less invasive breast lines) but was expressed at a significantly higher level in {MDA-MB-231} and {BT-20} cells (invasive breast lines) as assayed by Western blot. The tissue factor gene promoter was activated, and forced expression of tissue factor {cDNA} was achieved in {MCF-7} cells, implying that the {3'-UTR} of the tissue factor transcript is responsible for the suppression of tissue factor expression.

While different T cell assays are being developed for these purposes, it is important to optimize and standardize methods for processing human blood samples for these assays. To this end, we review data relevant to critical parameters in peripheral blood mononuclear cell {(PBMC)} isolation, (cryo)preservation, distribution and usage for detecting antigen-specific T cell responses. Based on these data, we propose recommendations on processing blood samples for T cell assays and identify gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. These recommendations may be relevant not only for the analysis of T cell responses in autoimmune disease, but also in cancer and infectious disease, particularly in the context of clinical trials.},

While chromatin structure prior to receptor binding and nucleosome occupancy after binding are strikingly different for {ESR1} and {AR,} {ΔDHS} is highly predictive for both. {AR} binding is associated with changes in both local nucleosome occupancy and {DNase} I hypersensitivity. In contrast, while global {ESR1} binding is unrelated to changes in nucleosome occupancy, {DNase} I hypersensitivity dynamics are also predictive of the {ESR1} cistrome.

  abstract = {Nucleosomes are important for gene regulation because their arrangement on the genome can control which proteins bind to {DNA.} Currently, few human nucleosomes are thought to be consistently positioned across cells; however, this has been difficult to assess due to the limited resolution of existing data. We performed paired-end sequencing of micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin {(MNase–seq)} from seven lymphoblastoid cell lines and mapped over 3.6 billion {MNase–seq} fragments to the human genome to create the highest-resolution map of nucleosome occupancy to date in a human cell type. In contrast to previous results, we find that most nucleosomes have more consistent positioning than expected by chance and a substantial fraction (8.7\%) of nucleosomes have moderate to strong positioning. In aggregate, nucleosome sequences have 10 bp periodic patterns in dinucleotide frequency and {DNase} I sensitivity; and, across cells, nucleosomes frequently have translational offsets that are multiples of 10 bp. We estimate that almost half of the genome contains regularly spaced arrays of nucleosomes, which are enriched in active chromatin domains. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce {DNase} I sensitivity can disrupt the phasing of nucleosome arrays, which indicates that they often result from positioning against a barrier formed by other proteins. However, nucleosome arrays can also be created by {DNA} sequence alone. The most striking example is an array of over 400 nucleosomes on chromosome 12 that is created by tandem repetition of sequences with strong positioning properties. In summary, a large fraction of nucleosomes are consistently positioned—in some regions because they adopt favored sequence positions, and in other regions because they are forced into specific arrangements by chromatin remodeling or {DNA} binding proteins.},

Because only a small fraction of trait-associated variants can be linked to coding sequences, investigators have speculated that many of the underlying causal alleles influence non-coding gene regulatory sites. Recent studies have successfully identified examples of mechanisms for non-coding alleles at individual loci. Now, genome-wide chromatin assays have resulted in maps of dozens of genomic annotations of the non-coding genome across multiple different tissues, cell types and cell lines. This gives a tremendous opportunity to integrate these annotations with complex trait signals to globally interpret associated variants, and prioritize likely causal alleles. Here, we review the examples of mechanisms by which non-coding, common alleles result in phenotypes. We discuss the efforts to integrate common trait-associated variants with genomic annotations. Finally, we highlight some caveats of these approaches and outline future directions for improvement.},

After an overnight resting significantly higher numbers of functionally active T cells were detectable by {ICS} for all tested antigen specificities, whereas the total number of antigen specific T cells determined by multimer staining remained unchanged.

  abstract = {Deep sequencing of mammalian {DNA} methylomes has uncovered a previously unpredicted number of discrete hypomethylated regions in intergenic space {(iHMRs).} Here, we combined whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data with extensive gene expression and chromatin-state data to define functional classes of {iHMRs,} and to reconstruct the dynamics of their establishment in a developmental setting. Comparing {HMR} profiles in embryonic stem and primary blood cells, we show that {iHMRs} mark an exclusive subset of active {DNase} hypersensitive sites {(DHS),} and that both developmentally constitutive and cell-type-specific {iHMRs} display chromatin states typical of distinct regulatory elements. We also observe that {iHMR} changes are more predictive of nearby gene activity than the promoter {HMR} itself, and that expression of noncoding {RNAs} within the {iHMR} accompanies full activation and complete demethylation of mature B cell enhancers. Conserved sequence features corresponding to {iHMR} transcript start sites, including a discernible {TATA} motif, suggest a conserved, functional role for transcription in these regions. Similarly, we explored both primate-specific and human population variation at {iHMRs,} finding that while enhancer {iHMRs} are more variable in sequence and methylation status than any other functional class, conservation of the {TATA} box is highly predictive of {iHMR} maintenance, reflecting the impact of sequence plasticity and transcriptional signals on {iHMR} establishment. Overall, our analysis allowed us to construct a three-step timeline in which (1) intergenic {DHS} are pre-established in the stem cell, (2) partial demethylation of blood-specific intergenic {DHSs} occurs in blood progenitors, and (3) complete {iHMR} formation and transcription coincide with enhancer activation in lymphoid-specified cells.},

Of particular interest is the discovery of differentially expressed genes across different conditions (e.g., tissues, perturbations) while optionally adjusting for other systematic factors that affect the data-collection process. There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol presents a state-of-the-art computational and statistical {RNA-seq} differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software and, in particular, on two widely used tools, {DESeq} and {edgeR.} Hands-on time for typical small experiments (e.g., 4-10 samples) can be \&lt;1 h, with computation time \&lt;1 d using a standard desktop {PC.}},

  abstract = {The Illumina {NexteraXT} transposon protocol is a cost effective way to generate paired end libraries. However the resulting insert size is highly sensitive to the concentration of {DNA} used, and the variation of insert sizes is often large. One consequence of this is some fragments may have an insert shorter than the length of a single read, particularly where the library is designed to produce overlapping paired end reads in order to produce longer continuous sequences. Such small insert sizes mean fewer longer reads, and also result in the presence of adapter at the end of the read. Here is presented a protocol to use publicly available tools to identify read pairs with small insert sizes and so likely to contain adapter, to check the sequence of the adapter, and remove adapter sequence from the reads. This protocol does not require a reference genome or prior knowledge of the sequence to be trimmed. Whilst the presence of fragments with small insert sizes may be a particular problem for {NexteraXT} libraries, the principle can be applied to any Illumina dataset in which the presence of such small inserts is suspected.},

However, until recently, we have known little about the mechanisms by which most regulatory variants act. For instance, what types of functional elements in {DNA,} {RNA,} or proteins are most often affected by regulatory variants? Which stages of gene regulation are typically altered? How can we predict which variants are most likely to impact regulation in a given cell type? Recent studies, in many cases using quantitative trait loci {(QTL)-mapping} approaches in cell lines or tissue samples, have provided us with considerable insight into the properties of genetic loci that have regulatory roles. Such studies have uncovered novel biochemical regulatory interactions and led to the identification of previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms. We have learned that genetic variation is often directly associated with variation in regulatory activities (namely, we can map regulatory {QTLs,} not just expression {QTLs} {[eQTLs]),} and we have taken the first steps towards understanding the causal order of regulatory events (for example, the role of pioneer transcription factors). Yet, in most cases, we still do not know how to interpret overlapping combinations of regulatory interactions, and we are still far from being able to predict how variation in regulatory mechanisms is propagated through a chain of interactions to eventually result in changes in gene expression profiles.},

Notably, the loss of {SHP} results in accumulation of damaged mitochondria and a sustained interaction between {NLRP3} and {ASC} in the endoplasmic reticulum. These data are suggestive of a role for {SHP} in controlling {NLRP3} inflammasome activation through a mechanism involving interaction with {NLRP3} and maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis.},

The method combines deep, long-read chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing {(ChIP-seq)} with a statistical test that simultaneously scores peak height correlation and allelic imbalance: the genotype-independent signal correlation and imbalance {(G-SCI)} test. We performed histone acetylation {ChIP-seq} on 57 human lymphoblastoid cell lines and used the resulting reads to call 500,066 single-nucleotide polymorphisms de novo within regulatory elements. The {G-SCI} test annotated 8,764 of these as histone acetylation {QTLs} {(haQTLs)-an} order of magnitude larger than the set of candidates detected by expression {QTL} analysis. Lymphoblastoid {haQTLs} were highly predictive of autoimmune disease mechanisms. Thus, our method facilitates large-scale regulatory variant detection in any moderately sized cohort for which functional profiling data can be generated, thereby simplifying identification of causal variants within {GWAS} loci.},

  abstract = {Background Recently mixed linear models are used to address the issue of "missing" heritability in traditional Genome-wide association studies {(GWAS).} The models assume that all single-nucleotide polymorphisms {(SNPs)} are associated with the phenotypes of interest. However, it is more common that only a small proportion of {SNPs} have significant effects on the phenotypes, while most {SNPs} have no or very small effects. To incorporate this feature, we propose an efficient Hierarchical Bayesian Model {(HBM)} that extends the existing mixed models to enforce automatic selection of significant {SNPs.} The {HBM} models the {SNP} effects using a mixture distribution of a point mass at zero and a normal distribution, where the point mass corresponds to those non-associative {SNPs.} Results We estimate the {HBM} using Gibbs sampling. The estimation performance of our method is first demonstrated through two simulation studies. We make the simulation setups realistic by using parameters fitted on the Framingham Heart Study {(FHS)} data. The simulation studies show that our method can accurately estimate the proportion of {SNPs} associated with the simulated phenotype and identify these {SNPs,} as well as adapt to certain model mis-specification than the standard mixed models. In addition, we analyze data from the {FHS} and the Health and Retirement Study {(HRS)} to study the association between Body Mass Index {(BMI)} and {SNPs} on Chromosome 16, and replicate the identified genetic associations. The analysis of the {FHS} data identifies 0.3\% {SNPs} on Chromosome 16 that affect {BMI,} including rs9939609 and rs9939973 on the {FTO} gene. These two {SNPs} are in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1558902 {(Rsq=0.901} for rs9939609 and Rsq=0.905 for rs9939973), which has been reported to be linked with obesity in previous {GWAS.} We then replicate the findings using the {HRS} data: the analysis finds 0.4\% of {SNPs} associated with {BMI} on Chromosome 16. Furthermore, around 25\% of the genes that are identified to be associated with {BMI} are common between the two studies. Conclusions The results demonstrate that the {HBM} and the associated estimation algorithm offer a powerful tool for identifying significant genetic associations with phenotypes of interest, among a large number of {SNPs} that are common in modern genetics studies.},

We identify over 1.6 million shared and cell type–restricted interactions spanning hundreds of kilobases between promoters and distal loci. Transcriptionally active genes contact enhancer-like elements, whereas transcriptionally inactive genes interact with previously uncharacterized elements marked by repressive features that may act as long-range silencers. Finally, we show that interacting loci are enriched for disease-associated {SNPs,} suggesting how distal mutations may disrupt the regulation of relevant genes. This study provides new insights and accessible tools to dissect the regulatory interactions that underlie normal and aberrant gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Integrator is a multi-subunit complex stably associated with the carboxy-terminal domain {(CTD)} of {RNA} polymerase {II} {(RNAPII).} Integrator is endowed with a core catalytic {RNA} endonuclease activity, which is required for the 3'-end processing of non-polyadenylated, {RNAPII-dependent,} uridylate-rich, small nuclear {RNA} genes. Here we examine the requirement of Integrator in the biogenesis of transcripts derived from distal regulatory elements (enhancers) involved in tissue- and temporal-specific regulation of gene expression in metazoans. Integrator is recruited to enhancers and super-enhancers in a stimulus-dependent manner. Functional depletion of Integrator subunits diminishes the signal-dependent induction of enhancer {RNAs} {(eRNAs)} and abrogates stimulus-induced enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. Global nuclear run-on and {RNAPII} profiling reveals a role for Integrator in 3'-end cleavage of {eRNA} primary transcripts leading to transcriptional termination. In the absence of Integrator, {eRNAs} remain bound to {RNAPII} and their primary transcripts accumulate. Notably, the induction of {eRNAs} and gene expression responsiveness requires the catalytic activity of Integrator complex. We propose a role for Integrator in biogenesis of {eRNAs} and enhancer function in metazoans.},

Genome-wide studies demonstrate a high degree of genetic overlap, but these diseases have mutually exclusive clinical phenotypes and opposing immune mechanisms. Despite their prevalence, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis very rarely co-occur within one individual. By utilizing genome-wide association study and {ImmunoChip} data from \&gt;19,000 individuals and methodologies developed from meta-analysis, we have identified opposing risk alleles at shared loci as well as independent disease-specific loci within the epidermal differentiation complex (chromosome 1q21.3), the Th2 locus control region (chromosome 5q31.1), and the major histocompatibility complex (chromosome 6p21-22). We further identified previously unreported pleiotropic alleles with opposing effects on atopic dermatitis and psoriasis risk in {PRKRA} and {ANXA6/TNIP1.} In contrast, there was no evidence for shared loci with effects operating in the same direction on both diseases. Our results show that atopic dermatitis and psoriasis have distinct genetic mechanisms with opposing effects in shared pathways influencing epidermal differentiation and immune response. The statistical analysis methods developed in the conduct of this study have produced additional insight from previously published data sets. The approach is likely to be applicable to the investigation of the genetic basis of other complex traits with overlapping and distinct clinical features.},

Previous genome-wide association studies {(GWAS)} and a recent meta-analysis using Immunochip data have uncovered 36 susceptibility loci. Here, we extend our previous meta-analysis of European ancestry by refined genotype calling and imputation and by the addition of 5,033 cases and 5,707 controls. The combined analysis, consisting of over 15,000 cases and 27,000 controls, identifies five new psoriasis susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance {(P\{\textless\}5} {\texttimes} 10−8). The newly identified signals include two that reside in intergenic regions (1q31.1 and 5p13.1) and three residing near {PLCL2} (3p24.3), {NFKBIZ} (3q12.3) and {CAMK2G} (10q22.2). We further demonstrate that {NFKBIZ} is a {TRAF3IP2-dependent} target of {IL-17} signalling in human skin keratinocytes, thereby functionally linking two strong candidate genes. These results further integrate the genetics and immunology of psoriasis, suggesting new avenues for functional analysis and improved therapies.},

  abstract = {The most abundant {mRNA} post-transcriptional modification is N(6)-methyladenosine {(m(6)A),} which has broad roles in {RNA} biology. In mammalian cells, the asymmetric distribution of {m(6)A} along {mRNAs} results in relatively less methylation in the 5' untranslated region {(5'UTR)} compared to other regions. However, whether and how {5'UTR} methylation is regulated is poorly understood. Despite the crucial role of the {5'UTR} in translation initiation, very little is known about whether {m(6)A} modification influences {mRNA} translation. Here we show that in response to heat shock stress, certain adenosines within the {5'UTR} of newly transcribed {mRNAs} are preferentially methylated. We find that the dynamic {5'UTR} methylation is a result of stress-induced nuclear localization of {YTHDF2,} a well-characterized {m(6)A} 'reader'. Upon heat shock stress, the nuclear {YTHDF2} preserves {5'UTR} methylation of stress-induced transcripts by limiting the {m(6)A} 'eraser' {FTO} from demethylation. Remarkably, the increased {5'UTR} methylation in the form of {m(6)A} promotes cap-independent translation initiation, providing a mechanism for selective {mRNA} translation under heat shock stress. Using Hsp70 {mRNA} as an example, we demonstrate that a single {m(6)A} modification site in the {5'UTR} enables translation initiation independent of the 5' end N(7)-methylguanosine cap. The elucidation of the dynamic features of {5'UTR} methylation and its critical role in cap-independent translation not only expands the breadth of physiological roles of {m(6)A,} but also uncovers a previously unappreciated translational control mechanism in heat shock response.},

Recent genome-wide studies discovered that tissue-specific differentially methylated regions {(DMRs)} often overlap tissue-specific distal cis-regulatory elements. However, developmental {DNA} methylation dynamics of the majority of the genomic {CpGs} outside gene promoters and {CpG} islands has not been extensively characterized. Here, we generate and compare comprehensive {DNA} methylome maps of zebrafish developing embryos. From these maps, we identify thousands of developmental stage-specific {DMRs} {(dsDMRs)} across zebrafish developmental stages. The {dsDMRs} contain evolutionarily conserved sequences, are associated with developmental genes and are marked with active enhancer histone posttranslational modifications. Their methylation pattern correlates much stronger than promoter methylation with expression of putative target genes. When tested in vivo using a transgenic zebrafish assay, 20 out of 20 selected candidate {dsDMRs} exhibit functional enhancer activities. Our data suggest that developmental enhancers are a major target of {DNA} methylation changes during embryogenesis.},

  abstract = {The skin represents the primary interface between the host and the environment. This organ is also home to trillions of microorganisms that play an important role in tissue homeostasis and local immunity. Skin microbial communities are highly diverse and can be remodelled over time or in response to environmental challenges. How, in the context of this complexity, individual commensal microorganisms may differentially modulate skin immunity and the consequences of these responses for tissue physiology remains unclear. Here we show that defined commensals dominantly affect skin immunity and identify the cellular mediators involved in this specification. In particular, colonization with Staphylococcus epidermidis induces {IL-17A(+)} {CD8(+)} T cells that home to the epidermis, enhance innate barrier immunity and limit pathogen invasion. Commensal-specific T-cell responses result from the coordinated action of skin-resident dendritic cell subsets and are not associated with inflammation, revealing that tissue-resident cells are poised to sense and respond to alterations in microbial communities. This interaction may represent an evolutionary means by which the skin immune system uses fluctuating commensal signals to calibrate barrier immunity and provide heterologous protection against invasive pathogens. These findings reveal that the skin immune landscape is a highly dynamic environment that can be rapidly and specifically remodelled by encounters with defined commensals, findings that have profound implications for our understanding of tissue-specific immunity and pathologies.},

The algorithm is based on three steps. Firstly, it identifies the biological pathways (gene ontology) in which the genes under analysis play a role {(GeneMANIA).} Secondly, it identifies the group of {SNPs} that best fits the phenotype (and covariates) under analysis, not considering individual {SNP} regression coefficients but fitting the regression for the group itself.

Understanding the mechanisms by which this phenomenon leads to disease is necessary to translate results from genetic association studies to the clinic. Assigning function to this type of variation is notoriously difficult because the human genome harbours a complex regulatory landscape with a dizzying array of transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as enhancers that have unpredictable, promiscuous and context-dependent behaviour. In this Review, we discuss how technological advances have provided increasingly detailed information on genome folding; for example, genome folding forms loops that bring enhancers and target genes into close proximity. We also now know that enhancers function within topologically associated domains, which are structural and functional units of chromosomes. Studying disease-associated mutations and chromosomal rearrangements in the context of the {3D} genome will enable the identification of dysregulated target genes and aid the progression from descriptive genetic association results to discovering molecular mechanisms underlying disease.},

The T cell receptor {(TCR)} repertoire is highly diverse to account for the highly heterogeneous antigenic world. During the response to a virus multiple individual clones of antigen specific {CD8+} {(Ag-specific)} T cells can be identified against a single epitope and multiple epitopes are recognised. Advances in single-cell technologies have provided the potential to study Ag-specific T cell heterogeneity at both surface phenotype and transcriptome levels, thereby allowing investigation of the diversity within the same apparent sub-population. We propose a new method {(VDJPuzzle)} to reconstruct the native {TCRαβ} from single cell {RNA-seq} data of Ag-specific T cells and then to link these with the gene expression profile of individual cells. We applied this method using rare Ag-specific T cells isolated from peripheral blood of a subject who cleared hepatitis C virus infection. We successfully reconstructed productive {TCRαβ} in 56 of a total of 63 cells (89\%), with double α and double β in 18, and 7\% respectively, and double {TCRαβ} in 2 cells. The method was validated via standard single cell {PCR} sequencing of the {TCR.} We demonstrate that single-cell transcriptome analysis can successfully distinguish Ag-specific T cell populations sorted directly from resting memory cells in peripheral blood and sorted after ex vivo stimulation. This approach allows a detailed analysis of the {TCR} diversity and its relationship with the transcriptional profile of different clones.},

However, there is increasing evidence that the missing heritability in psoriasis could be explained by multiple genetic variants of low effect size from common genetic pathways. The objective of this study was to identify new genetic variation associated with psoriasis risk at the pathway level. We genotyped 598,258 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a discovery cohort of 2,281 case-control individuals from Spain. We performed a genome-wide pathway analysis using 1,053 reference biological pathways. A total of 14 genetic pathways {(PFDR} \&\#x2264; 2.55 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-2)) were found to be significantly associated with psoriasis risk. Using an independent validation cohort of 7,353 individuals from the {UK,} a total of 6 genetic pathways were significantly replicated {(PFDR} \&\#x2264; 3.46 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-2)). We found genetic pathways that had not been previously associated with psoriasis risk such as retinol metabolism {(Pcombined\&\#xA0;=} 1.84 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-4)), the transport of inorganic ions and amino acids {(Pcombined\&\#xA0;=} 1.57 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-7)), and post-translational protein modification {(Pcombined\&\#xA0;=} 1.57 {\&\#xD7;} 10(-7)). In the latter pathway, {MGAT5} showed a strong network centrality, and its association with psoriasis risk was further validated in an additional case-control cohort of 3,429 individuals {(P} \&lt; 0.05).

We used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the dynamic effects of four silencers associated with diverse modifications: {DNA} methylation, histone deacetylation, and histone methylation. For all regulators, silencing and reactivation occurred in all-or-none events, enabling the regulators to modulate the fraction of cells silenced rather than the amount of gene expression. These dynamics could be described by a three-state model involving stochastic transitions between active, reversibly silent, and irreversibly silent states. Through their individual transition rates, these regulators operate over different time scales and generate distinct types of epigenetic memory. Our results provide a framework for understanding and engineering mammalian chromatin regulation and epigenetic memory.},

Requiring few types of input data, we are able to apply our method to reconstruct the enhancer-target networks in 935 samples of human primary cells, tissues and cell lines, which constitute by far the largest set of enhancer-target networks. The similarity of these networks from different samples closely follows their cell and tissue lineages. We discover three major co-regulation modes of enhancers and find defense-related genes often simultaneously regulated by multiple enhancers bound by different transcription factors. We also identify differentially methylated enhancers in hepatocellular carcinoma {(HCC)} and experimentally confirm their altered regulation of {HCC-related} genes.},

Analysing the {TCR} repertoire may help to gain a better understanding of the immune system features and of the aetiology and progression of diseases, in particular those with unknown antigenic triggers. The extreme diversity of the {TCR} repertoire represents a major analytical challenge; this has led to the development of specialized methods which aim to characterize the {TCR} repertoire in-depth. Currently, next generation sequencing based technologies are most widely employed for the high-throughput analysis of the immune cell repertoire. Here, we report on the latest methodological advancements in the field by describing and comparing the available tools; from the choice of the starting material and library preparation method, to the sequencing technologies and data analysis. Finally, we provide a practical example and our own experience by reporting some exemplary results from a small internal benchmark study, where current approaches from the literature and the market are employed and compared. Several valid methods for clonotype identification and {TCR} repertoire analysis exist, however, a gold standard method for the field has not yet been identified. Depending on the purpose of the scientific study, some approaches may be more suitable than others.

Using {eQTLs} from three major immune subpopulations, we found shared effects in only {\&\#x223C;25\%} of the loci examined.

  abstract = {Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin that is sometimes accompanied by an auto-inflammatory arthritis called psoriatic arthritis {(PsA).} Psoriasis and {PsA} are multifactorial diseases that result from complex interactions of environmental and genetic risk factors. Epigenetic marks, which are labile chemical marks with diverse functions, form a layer of biological information that sits at the interface of genetics and the environment. Aberrant epigenetic regulation has been previously implicated in other rheumatological disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the nascent literature on epigenetics in psoriasis and {PsA.} A systematic review yielded 52 primary articles after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted using a standardized template and study quality assessed using a methodological quality checklist. Studies reflect a broad range of epigenetic sub-disciplines, the most common being {DNA} methylation, followed by the parent of origin effect or genomic imprinting, expression or activity of epigenetic modifying enzymes, and histone modifications. Epidemiological studies demonstrating excessive paternal transmission provided the earliest evidence of epigenetic deregulation in psoriatic disease, however few studies have examined its molecular mechanisms. Methylation studies evolved rapidly from low resolution global to targeted analyses of known psoriatic disease susceptibility loci such as {HLA-C*0602.} The recent explosion of epigenome-wide association studies has provided us with novel insights into psoriasis pathogenesis, and the mechanism of action of {UVB,} methotrexate, and {anti-TNF} therapies, as well as molecular signatures of psoriasis that may have clinical relevance. Finally, recent studies of pharmacological inhibitors of epigenetic modifier enzymes demonstrate their potential applicability as novel treatment modalities for psoriasis. Challenges of epigenetics research in psoriasis and {PsA} were identified and future perspectives are discussed herein.},

An exchange of a 20-bp spacer sequence in the {gRNA} can easily reprogram Cas9 to target a different {DNA} site. By expressing or providing multiple {gRNAs,} the system also enables multiplex genome editing at high efficiencies. Current approaches for providing multiple {gRNAs} in vivo include the use of multigene cassettes to express several {gRNAs,} Csy4-based excision, arrays of {crRNAs,} ribozyme-flanked {gRNAs,} {tRNA-dependent} cleavage of {gRNAs,} and direct introduction of Cas9 proteins preloaded with different {gRNAs.} By simultaneously targeting multiple {DNA} sequences, multiplex genome editing can be used to knockout multiple genes or delete chromosomal fragments. Off-target risk can also be reduced by Cas9-dimers that require the simultaneous expression of two {gRNAs.} With multiple {gRNAs,} specific gene expression or methylation status can be efficiently controlled by {dCas9} fused to activators, repressors, methyltransferase, demethylase, or other functional domains.

  abstract      = {Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes methods for preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing, and simulation of gene regulatory networks. Its Python-based implementation efficiently deals with data sets of more than one million cells (https://github. {com/theislab/Scanpy).} Along with Scanpy, we present {AnnData,} a generic class for handling annotated data matrices (https://github. com/theislab/anndata).},

  abstract      = {Single-cell {RNA-sequencing} is revolutionizing biological discovery. However, {scRNA-seq} technologies suffer from many sources of significant technical noise, the most prominent being undersampling of {mRNA} molecules, often termed 'dropout'. Dropout can severely obscure important gene-gene relationships and impedes the possibility of learning gene regulatory networks at single cell resolution. To address this, we developed {MAGIC} {(Markov} Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells), a computational approach that shares information~…},
