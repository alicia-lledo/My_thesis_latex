\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The relevance of cell type and tissue specificity in the study of PsA}

Consideration of cell and type specificity in the study of complex diseases is fundamental for the understanding of the disease pathophysiology. As previously reviewed (\ref{ch:Intro}), the dysregulated immune response in PsA is the results of the interaction between cellular components of the innate and adaptive immune response. Consequently, the molecular characterisation of the different immune cell types is pivotal not only for the understanding of the immune response but also to define disease state, comprehend the impact of genetic variants increasing disease risk and identify drugs with optimal efficacy and specificity.

PsA is considered a systemic disease where studies in PBMCs have demonstrated changes in cell type composition and cytokine production when compared to healthy individuals. For example, increased frequencies of circulating IL-17$^+$ and IL-22$^+$ CD4$^+$ T cells have been reported in PB from PsA patients compared to control individuals \parencite{Benham2013}. Moreover, reduced percentage of pDCs and NK in PB have also been observed in PB from PsA compared to controls \parencite{Jongbloed2006, Spadaro2004}. In terms of cytokine production, stimulated PBMCs from PsA patients released greater levels of IL-17 and IL-22 than the healthy control counterparts \parencite{Benham2013}. 

Nevertheless, PsA is characterised by involvement of the joints, where repeated local inflammatory response leads eventually to joint destruction. Oligoarticular PsA (involving four or fewer joints) is commonly managed by joint aspiration followed by intra-articular steroid injection to relieve pain, facilitating the sample collection for research purposes \parencite{Kavanaugh2006}. The importance of studying the synovium in PsA have been highlighted by differences in cell composition and cytokine production, amongst others, between PB and SF in PsA patients. For example, expansion mCD8$^+$ but not mCD4$^+$ T cells was observed in SF when compared to PB in PsA paired samples \parencite{Ross2000}. Additionally, elevated proportion of T cells expressing the cytokine receptors CCR6$^+$ and IL-23R$^+$ were found in SF compared to PB in patients \parencite{Benham2013}.


\subsection{Bulk transcriptomic studies in PsA and their limitations}

Genome-wide transcriptomic studies in PsA have been mainly focused in characterising gene expression in bulk PBMCs and SFMCs samples. Several studies have been conducted to better understand gene expression differences in blood between PsA and controls and also specific differences between PB and SF from the same PsA patients or differences with other arthritic diseases \parencite{Stoeckman2006, Batiwalla2005, Gu2002, Dolcino2015}. Amongst the most comprehensives of these studies, that conducted by Dolcino and colleagues revealed genes from the Th-17 axis and type-I IFN signalling to be differentially expressed between PsA and healthy controls in synovial membranes. Moreover, the overlap of genes that were differentially expressed between patients and controls in each of the compartments, highlighted differences and commonalities in the systemic and synovial immune response in PsA. %Other studies have also focused in the understanding the transcriptional changes in PBMCs from PsA patients following MTX and TNFi therapies \parencite{Cuchacovich2014}. 
Cytokines production measurements have also been conducted in serum and SF, revealing increased levels of TNF-$\alpha$, for example, in both tissues \parencite{Ritchlin1999,Li2017}. 

Studies using mixed cell populations can be influenced by the relative proportion of the different cell populations within the sample \parencite{Whitney2003}. For instance, the importance of considering cell types to understand the impact of genetic variants in transcriptional regulation has been explored in a number of immune cells \parencite{Fairfax2012, Fairfax2014, Raj2014, Peters2016, Kasela2017}. These studies have highlighted the regulatory role of some genetic variants only in particular cell types and conditions, previously masked when considering mixed population of cells such as PBMCs. In this respect, expression analysis for a limited number of genes have been performed in specific cell type populations such as stimulated macrophages and Th-17 \textit{in vitro} differentiated cells from na\"{i}ve CD4$^+$ isolated from PB and SF of PsA patients \parencite{Antoniv2006, Leipe2010}. The importance of investigating the transcriptional profile of patients' isolated discrete cell populations have yielded interesting findings in monocytes and Th-17 cells in AS, intestinal epithelial cells in CD and fibroblast-like synoviocytes in RA \parencite{Al-Mossawi2017,Smith2008, Howell2018, Ai2016}. Overall, achieving a detailed and precise understanding of complex diseases requires the study of sorted cell populations and when possible isolated from the affected tissue.  


\subsection{Transcriptomics and proteomics at the single cell resolution}

In addition to the study of specific cell types, evidence for heterogeneity in the transcriptome within cells from the same population has accelerated the development of strategies providing single cell resolution. The establishment of scRNA-seq and mass-cytometry techniques represent an unbiased way to characterise and identify cell subpopulations within the samples, avoiding the pre-selection of particular cell types and thus providing a global overview of cell composition and interactions in the tissue of interest. 

A wide range of approaches to study single-cell transcriptomics have been developed in the last few years, including Drop-seq, SmartSeq2 and 10X Chromium amongst the most widely used \parencite{Picelli2014,Ziegenhain2017}. 10X Chromium technology is based on microfluidics where cells in suspension get directly encapsulated into nanoL droplets that incorporate cell and transcript barcode identifiers (see \ref{ch:Mat}). As a result, 10X Chromium technology does not require pre-sorting of single-cells into plates and enables higher throughput than other with less manipulation and variability than other scRNA-seq methods such as SmartSeq2 \parencite{Baran-Gale2017}.
 
Mass cytometry represents the next generation of fluorescence based flow-cytometry analysis to interrogate expression of cell surface and intracellular molecules. Mass cytometry is a hybrid technique between mass spectrometry and flow cytometry, where the Abs recognising the molecular markers have been labelled with stable isotopes instead of fluorophores \parencite{Bandura2009}. The use of isotopes enables incorporating up to fourty-five Abs to profile cellular populations and assess molecular functions. 



\subsection{The challenges of using a multi-omics approach in the study of complex diseases}

The interaction between genetics and the environment can shape the cellular epigenetic landscape and eventually result in the development of complex diseases. This dynamism of the epigenome entails cell and context specific features which reinforce the importance of studying purified cell types instead of mixed populations. As previously mentioned, the epigenomic landscape has a pivotal role in understanding disease state and also contextualizing the role of putative genetic risk variants in the study of complex diseases. In this context, the implementation of multi-omics approaches in the study of complex diseases has enabled to better understand the relationship between the regulatory landscape, gene expression and protein translation in cell populations of interest. 

As previously highlighted in Chapter \ref{ch:Results2}, the methodological advances in the epigenetics field have allowed to map the regulatory landscape from clinical samples. This approach has facilitated the characterisation of the closest regulatory landscape to disease conditions using cell populations directly isolated from patients, instead of cultured cell lines or primary cells with additional stimulus, and the integration with the transcriptional profiles from paired samples. Incorporation of scRNA-seq and mass cytometry in addition to bulk RNA-seq and flow cytometry have led to a more detailed understanding of the immune system, accounting for the variability at the single-cell level in gene expression and protein translation \parencite{Jaitin2014, Villani2017,Bengsch2018}. In complex diseases such as RA, scRNA-seq has revealed heterogeneity in the synovial fibroblast population and identified a potentially pathogenic cluster highly proliferative and active in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion \parencite{Mizoguchi2018}. Similarly, mass cytometry analysis performed in RA identified an expanded CD4$^+$ T cell population promoting B cell response \parencite{Rao2017}.



%Recent technical advances such as ATAC-seq are enabling the characterisation of the regulatory landcape in a wide range of cell types and tissues obtained from valuable clinical samples minimising the amount of material required. Profiling the chromatin accessibility in the cell populations isolated from the tissues of interest provides details about the molecular programming of cells and can also inform about the location and status of \text{cis}-regulatory elements. For example differential analysis in B cells isolated from SLE and healthy controls has revealed changes in chromatin accessibility for loci nearby genes involved in B cells activation and enrichment for TFBS potentially regulating pathogenic processes \parencite{Scharer2016}. Similarly a study in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has identified the retina epithelium as the main tissue driving disease onset though global loss of chromatin accessibility compared to healthy tissue \parencite{Wang2018}. 


One of the most challenging aspects of using a multi-omics approach is the appropriate integration of the data in order to maximise the amount of information extracted and also the reliability of the findings. The power of this integration is increased by generating paired data for all the omics across all the individuals in the cohort, which cannot always be achieved due to sample availability and cost. Recently, Zhang and colleagues have published one of the most comprehensive available study integrating multi-omics (bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq and mass cytometry) in RA \parencite{Zhang2018}. This study performed isolation of the main pathophysiological cell types infiltrated into RA synovial membranes, including T cells, B cells, monocytes, and fibroblasts, and identified eighteen unique subpopulations by systematic correlation between transcriptional profiles and mass cytometry.



\subsection{Integration of fine-mapping GWAS SNPs and functional data in PsA}

As already explained in Chapters \ref{ch:Intro} and \ref{ch:Results2}, fine-mapping of the GWAS signals is required in order to reduce the putative number of causal SNPs accounting for a particular association in complex diseases. Fine-mapping using genotype level data incorporates a locus step-wise conditional analysis to identify independent secondary signals, prior to calculate PP and credible sets for each of them \parencite{Maller2012,Bunts2015}. In some cases, this enables to reduce the size of the region associated to disease and thus the number of putative causal SNPs that could be functionally relevant for the disease pathophysiology. Although fine-mapping reduces the number of putative causal SNPs from thousands to tens, additional integration of epigenetics and functional data as well as molecular assays are required to pinpoint the genetic variant and the mechanisms driving the association with disease.  

The PsA GWAS study conducted by Bowes and colleagues successfully performed fine-mapping for seventeen of the associated regions \parencite{Bowes2016}. This study provided a summary table for the overlap of SNPs from the 90\% credible set (list of SNPs explaining 90\% of the PsA GWAS association) with genomic annotations and ENCODE features (cell lines and healthy donors primary cells), to further narrow down the set of putative causal SNPs for each associations as well as the more relevant cell type where they may have an effect. Bowes \textit{et al.} further investigated the PsA-specific association identified in this study at the 5q31 region and a pilot eQTL study confirmed the most significant correlation with \textit{SLC22A5} expression for a SNP in high LD with the GWAS lead SNP.

Leveraging epigenetic data to further refine the candidate causal SNPs from fine-mapping studies could benefit from the generation of disease-specific chromatin regulatory maps in PsA affected tissue and, possibly, further integration of scRNA-seq and mass cytometry from the same individuals. Altogether, this data could represent an additional layer of information in the attempt to identify the causal variant driving GWAS associations with PsA and provide further insight into the disease pathophysiology. 

%Fine-mapping has been systematically applied to a number of immune-mediated GWAS, including T2D, IBD, AS and SLE \parencite{Maller2012,Gaulton2015,Bunt2015,Sun2016,Huang2017}. In contrast, systematic fine-mapping studies for all the sixty-three psoriasis GWAS loci have not been performed yet. In PsA, Bayesian fine-mapping has been conducted for some of the Immunochip GWAS associations, including the 5q31 PsA-specific locus  \parencite{Bowes2015}.
%
%% Maybe in the discussion
%Regardless the contribution towards dissecting causality, traditional Bayesian fine-mapping models assume only one causal SNP driving the association at each locus. As a way to partially address this limitation, these methods include a locus step-wise conditional analysis to identify independent secondary signals, prior to calculate PP and credible sets for each of them \parenicte{Maller2012,Bunts2015}. Improved methods such as stochastic Bayesian fine-mapping outperforms the step-wide Bayesian approached by avoiding the biases of the conditional analysis and considering all the possible models regarding number of putative causal SNPs to explain association of each locus \parencite{Wallace2016}
%
%The resolution of fine mapping studies could be enhanced by the integration of trans-ethnic fine-mapping meta-analysis, particularly by the inclusion of Yoruba (YRI) and Chinese Han (CHB) descendents 1000 Genomes samples with reduced LD blocks, that can shed light on the true independence of secondary signals \parencite{Bunt2015, Kichaev2015}.
%
%Recently, publicly available tools such as fGWAS and PAINTOR have leveraged cell type-specific annotation to inform the Bayesian analysis and output a further refine credible set of SNPs with functional relevance \parencite{Pickrell2014,Kichaev2015}.

%Traditional Bayesian fine-mapping models assume in the model only one causal SNP driving the association at each locus. As a way to partially address this limitation, genotype level fine-mapping incorporates a locus step-wise conditional analysis to identify independent secondary signals, prior to calculate PP and credible sets for each of them \parencite{Maller2012,Bunts2015}. A disadvantage of the methods performing fine-mapping from summary statistics data is the impossibility to perform this conditional analysis.



\subsection{Aims}

Regarding PsA, no such a comprehensive multi-omic study has been conducted to date. Characterisation of chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic landcape of the most relevant cell types in SF and PB would improve the understanding of differences across tissues as well as the relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression in PsA. Furthermore, implementation of single-cell transcriptomic and mass cytometry would help to  ......

%Example in PsA
 %For example, a genome-wide study of the methylome in PsA PBMCs revealed a hypomethylated pattern in na\"{i}ve patients compared to those under MTX treatment \parencite{Kim1996}.

\subsection{PsA patients cohort description and datasets}
In this study peripheral blood (PB) and SF were collected from a cohort of six PsA patients, with equal numbers of males and females (Table \ref{tab:PSA_cohort_metadata}). All the patients presented oligoarticular joint affection and had been first diagnosed with psoriasis. The cohort presented a mean of 1.5 tender or swollen affected joints (TJC66 and SJC66), which is characteristic of the oligoarticular form of disease, involving four or fewer joints. Regarding global assessment, the mean scores for the patient and physician evaluation were 3.2 and 3, respectively, in a scale of 1 to 5. These four measurements including joints and global assessment compose the PsARC disease activity scores, used by clinicians as the main indicator of response to treatment by recommendation of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (Chapter \ref{ch:Intro}). 

The mean age of the cohort at the time of diagnosis was 44.3 years old and the mean disease duration 8.8 years. Interestingly, PsA1728 was diagnosed at a later age compared to the other patients in the cohort (late PsA onset clinical significance??). Moreover, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a further marker of inflammation, presented an average of 17.45 mg/L and was particularly higher in PsA1719 and PsA1728 compared to the other patients. At the time of sample recruitment all the PsA patients were not on active immunosupressive therapy. Post-visit, most of the patients qualified for TNAi biologic therapy xxxx.

For each of the patients, paired PB and SF data was generated from bulk or isolated cell types of interest (detailed in Table \ref{tab:PSA_datasets_per_sample} and Chapter \ref{ch:Mat}). Due to project constrains, Fast-ATAC, PCR gene expression array, scRNA-seq and mass cytometry were not generated for all six individuals in the cohort.

\subsection{Immune cellular composition of blood and synovial fluid in the PsA cohort}
The immune cellular composition of three PsA samples (PsA1718, PsA1719 and PsA1607) was characterised in SF and PB using the ICS mass cytometry panel in Chapter \ref{ch:Mat}. For both tissues, mCD4$^+$ (between 32.1 and 55.6\%) constituted the most abundant cell type followed by mCD8$^+$ (between 16.9 and 24.9\%) and CD14$^+$ "non-classical" monocytes (between 6.9 and 21.7\%). Consistently with previous studies, a trend of increased percentage of mCD8$^+$ pDCs and cDCs was observed in SF compared to PB \parencite{Ross2000,Jongbloed2006}. This data also showed reduced percentage of SF NK cells percentage compared to PB, in line with previous studies suggesting the role of impaired non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity in PsA \parencite{Spadaro2004}. Similarly, a tendency towards reduced proportions of B cells in SF compared to PB reinforced the lack of contribution of the humoral immune response in PsA pathophysiology. The observed differences in cell composition between SF and PB were not statistically significant for any of the twelve analysed populations likely due to the small samples size (n=3) available for the analysis. Further increase in the sample size will probably prove statistical significance for the observed differences in immune cell composition between the two tissues reproducing the results published by other studies.

\subsection{Differential chromatin accessibility analysis in immune cells reveals differences between SF and PB}

\subsubsection{Quality control of Fast-ATAC data}
Twenty four Fast-ATAC PsA samples from four different cell types and two tissues (PB and SF) were sequenced and processes using the in-house pipeline as previously detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:Mat}. After filtering for low quality mapping, duplicates and MT reads, the median of total number of reads ranged between 46.6 and 70.2 millions (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_QC} a). Overall, MT and duplicated reads accounted for a median of 40 to 62.2\% from the total number of unfiltered reads depending on cell type (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_QC} b), contributing to the loss of reads in ATAC as previously detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:Results1}. %The final number of reads remaining after filtering was inversely related to the percentage of MT and duplicated reads identified. For example, mCD14$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ presented the lowest median of total number of reads after filtering concomitantly with the greatest percentage of combined MT and duplicated reads. 
%As previously mentioned, the MT DNA in ATAC-seq is one of the main sources of read loss, which is more accessible to the Tn5 transposase due to the absence of nucleosomes. Although the FAST-ATAC protocol represented an improvement, the percentage of MT reads across amongst all the samples ranged between 2.1 and 25.4\%. Similarly, despite initial optimisation of the number of PCR cycles used in the library amplification, the duplicated reads still represented between 22.9 to 55\% of the total number sequenced reads.

Regarding sample quality, TSS enrichment analysis showed differences in the levels of background noise across cell types and highlighted the variability of Fast-ATAC performance (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_QC} c). A general trend towards greater TSS enrichment in PB samples compared to SF was observed. mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ presented the best signal-to-noise ratios, with median of 19.1 and 23.1 fold enrichment, respectively. In contrast, NK was the cell type with the lowest TSS enrichment values. Particularly, the fold enrichment for PsA1719 and PsA1607 in NK were close to the 6 fold enrichment considered by ENCODE as acceptable. Given the limited cohort size, these samples were not excluded, but it is worth noting that they could be contributing noise and thus reducing the power of the differential analysis.

\end{figure}


When identifying open chromatin regions by peak calling followed by pval filtering based on IDR analysis, the number of accessible regions per sample ranged approximately between 24x10$^3$ and 97x10$^3$ (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_QC} d). The total number of called peaks passing filtering varied across cell types and was influenced by the quality sample, as previously demonstrated in Chapter \ref{ref:Results1}. Overall, appropriate number of peaks were called in all the samples and no concerning outliers were identified.
%For example, CD14$^+$ was the cell type with greatest number of called peaks (108.4$x10^3$) as well as the greater median of reads remaining after filtering when compared to the other three cell types (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_QC} a). 
%For example, the two NK samples with the greatest TSS enrichment (PSA1718 SF and PB) showed larger number of called peaks when compared to the other NK samples with similar number of reads but lower quality measured by TSS enrichment. This observation was consistent with the correlation between sample quality and the number of identified accessible chromatin regions previously demonstrated in Chapter \ref{ch:Results1}. 


\subsubsection{Accessible chromatin reflects cell type specificity and functional relevance}
A consensus master list of accessible chromatin regions identified across all the samples and cell types (ML\_ALL) was built, as previously explained in Chapter \ref{ch:Mat} and Chapter \ref{ch:Results1}. PCA analysis based on the normalised counts for each region of the ML\_ALL showed that most of the variability (PC1 65.6\% of the variability) in the chromatin landscape correlated with cell type, leading to sample separation in four cluster (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_PCA}). The myeloid (CD14$^+$ monocytes) and lymphoid (mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$) clusters appeared as the most different between them based on the Fast-ATAC profile. Conversely,the mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ clusters were the most similar between them, altogether supporting the ability of Fast-ATAC to capture cell type chromatin accessibility features. In addition to this, modest separation between SF and PB samples was also found in the mCD4$^+$, mCD8$^+$ and NK clusters (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_PCA}).

The first two PCs (x-axis and y-axis, respectively) of all the ATAC peaks included in the ML\_all are plotted.

\label{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_PCA}
\end{figure}



The ability to capture putative regulatory regions within the identified accessible chromatin regions was also explored. Enrichment analysis of different eQTL publicly available datasets for the regions contained in the MASTER\_ALL list was performed. Amongst the GTEx eQTL data, the largest (z-score) and most significant (-log$_10$FDR) enrichment was found for the venous blood data set (red dot), consistent with the cell types included in the study (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_eQTL_enrichment} a). In terms of publicly available eQTLs studies in immune cells, the strongest enrichment for the MASTER\_ALL regions were found for CD14$^+$ monocytes (importantly unstimulated, LPS 2h and IFN-$\gamma$ 24h) followed by mCD8$^+$ T cells (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_eQTL_enrichment} b). eQTLs in B cell appeared as the least enriched when compared to the other datasets, consistently with the absence of this cell type in the ATAC experiments, and reinforcing the cell specificity captured by this assay.

\subsubsection{CD14$^+$ monocytes present the greatest proportion of changes in chromatin accessibility}
A consensus master list of chromatin accessible regions was built for each of the four cell types of interest (ML\_CD14, ML\_CD4, ML\_CD8 and ML\_NK). Differential chromatin accessibility analysis between SF and PB was performed on the normalised counts retrieved for each of the cell type master lists using DESeq2 and a paired design (Table \ref{tab:PSA_DOCs_results}). A 80\% cut-off for background noise was used to filter the count matrix, as previously explained in Chapter \ref{Results3}. %Only differentially accessible regions (DARs) identified with DESeq2 and also shared with quantile normalisation limma voom analysis where considered downstream. 
The CD14$^+$ monocytes and NK were the two cell types presenting the greatest total number (5,285 and 2,314, respectively) and proportion of DARs (23.3 and 8.9\%, respectively). For each cell type, DARs were divided in DARs more open in SF compared to PB (SF open DARs) and DARs less open in SF compared to PB (PB open DARs). In CD14$^+$ monocytes the number of SF open DARS were notably larger than the number of PB open DARs (3,779 and 1,506DARs, respectively) (Table \ref{tab:PSA_DOCs_results}). Conversely, the number of SF and PB open DARs were similar for the other three cell types.

\label{tab:PSA_DOCs_results}
\end{table}

Permutation analysis was used to determine if the large number of DARs (particularly by comparison to limited finding in the psoriasis analysis) were more than would be expected by chance. None of the ten possible permutations demonstrated a greater number of DARs than the ones identified for the true groups, reinforcing the robustness of the differential analysis results (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_perm_analysis}).

  
Genomic annotation of the DARs identified in each the cell types revealed that 80\% or more of all regions with differential accessibility were located at intronic and intergenic regions (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_DOCS_annotation} a). Universal promoter regions was the third most represented genomic feature, accounting for the annotation of approximately between 5 to 15\% of the DARs in each cell type. In addition to this, the chromatin states from the Roadmap Epigenomics maps were also used for annotation (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_DOCS_annotation} b). For all four cell types,  between 44.96 and 72.11\% of the DARs were annotated as weak enhancers, which represented the most prominent category and the most significantly enriched (data not shown). The over-representation of enhancers was consistent with large percentage of introns and intergenic regions found for the genomic features annotation, as those are the preferred location for enhancer elements. Modest percentages of DARs were annotated as heterochromatin and repetitive regions but not significant enrichment for these two chromatin states was found for any of the four cell types (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_DOCS_annotation} b).

%Try to overlap the enhancer FANTOM data to id those regions whith evidence of eRNA expression
The functional relevance of the differential chromatin accessibility in terms of regulation of gene expression was further investigated by integration of the eRNA data from the FANTOM5 project. Statistically significant enrichment for robust and permissive enhancers was found for the DARs in all four cell types (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_FANTOM}).  Moreover, DARs from all four cell types also presented significant enrichment for the corresponding cell type eRNA set. The proportion of DARs overlapping the appropriate cell type set of expressed eRNAs ranged between 19.8\% (83 open in SF and 160 open in PB) in NK and 31.8\% (83 open in SF and 160 open in PB) in CD4$^+$ cells.

From the differential analysis between SF and PB, a number of DARs were overlapping a gene body (Table \ref{tab:PSA_DOCs_gene_body}). Interestingly, the majority were located within introns instead of untranslated regions (UTRs) annotated as weak or strong enhancers according to the cell type specific chromatin segmentation map previously illustrated. 

%Similarly, more accessible chromatin in SF compared to PB was identified in five regions of the \textit{IL15} gene, annotated as promoter and enhancers in CD14$^+$ monocytes.

For example, NK analysis identified a PB open DAR located in an intron of the \textit{VAV3} gene and also significantly expressed as eRNA (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_gene_boy_DOCS_CD14_NK} a). Additionally, a number of gene entities contained more than one DAR, showing the same direction of chromatin accessibility between SF and PB. For example, in CD14$^+$ two DARs located at the 5' and 3' UTRs of \textit{IL7R} gene were more accessible in SF compared to PB (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_gene_boy_DOCS_CD14_NK} b).

% GWAS overlap maybe indicate an example in CD14 that can be relevant with pathway analysis
%The relevance of the differences in chromatin accessibility in the context of psoriasis and PsA GWAS hits was also addressed. Enrichment analysis of psoriasis and PsA GWAS hits for the DARs in each cell type was performed using XGR co-localisation and permutation analysis. At the SNP level, no significant enrichment was reported between DARs and GWAS lead SNPs and those in LD r$^2$$\geq$8. When the enrichment analysis was performed for the psoriasis and PsA LD blocks, significant enrichment (2-fold enrichment and empirical p-val 0.043) was observed only for the CD14$^+$ DARs.

In all four cell types, overlap between putative psoriasis and PsA GWAS genes and proximal ($\leq$5Kb) DARs were found. CD14$^+$ monocytes presented the largest number of overlaps (12), followed by mCD8$^+$ (9), NK$^+$ (8) and mCD4$^+$ (4). For example, DARs proximal to \textit{ELMO1} and \textit{RUNX3} were found for all the cell types. Co-localisation and permutation analysis to explore the enrichment of DARs for PsA and psoriasis GWAS LD blocks only found significance in CD14$^+$ monocytes (empirical pval=0.043).

\subsection{Pathway enrichment analysis highlights tissue functional differences in chromatin accessibility}

Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted separately for SF open DARs and PB open DARs in each cell type. Gene annotation of the DARs was performed by physical proximity, as detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:Mat}. Despite commonalities, differences in significant enriched pathways (FDR$<$0.01 or 0.05) were also identified within the same cell type between SF and PB open DARs (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_ATAC_pathway_analysis_all_DOC}). In CD14$^+$ monocytes SF open DARs presented enrichment for pathways involved in regulation of immunity, inflammation and cell survival such as the NF-$\kappa$B pathway and cytokine related pathways, including IL-2 and IL-3, 5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signalling (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_ATAC_pathway_analysis_all_DOC} a). 

mCD4$^+$ SF open DARs compared to PB open DARs showed enrichment for TCR signalling as well as chemokine signalling, which included, amongst others, DARs in proximity to IFN-$\gamma$ or \textit{CXCL13} and \textit{CXCR6}, respectively (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_ATAC_pathway_analysis_all_DOC} b). T cell signaling pathway appeared only enriched for SF open DARs in mCD4$^+$; however PB open DARs in this cell type were also enriched for focal adhesion members, also involved in the T cell activation \parencite{Dustin2001}. Enriched pathways for SF or PB open DARs in mCD8$^+$ were only significant when using an FDR$<$0.05 threshold. (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_ATAC_pathway_analysis_all_DOC} c). The G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling, with varied roles in regulation of inflammation and mediation of the chemotactic recruitment of T cells to the inflamed tissue, was enriched for mCD8$^+$ PB open DARs. mCD8$^+$ SF open DARs showed enrichment for the Wnt signaling pathway involved in the production of memory cells with enhanced proliferative potential and stronger protective capacity \parencite{Boudousquie2014,}. 

NK SF open DARs presented enrichment for Fc-gamma receptor (FC$\gamma$R)-mediated phagocytosis (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_ATAC_pathway_analysis_all_DOC} d). Moreover, members of the HIF-1 pathway involved in oxygen homeostasis were also enriched in NK SF open DARs, in line with the hypoxic environment found in joint inflammation. Interestingly, enrichment of open PB DARs in the proximity of genes involved in NK-mediated toxicity was unveiled.

\subsection{Differential gene expression analysis in paired circulating and synovial immune cells}

\subsubsection{Immune-relevant gene expression by qPCR}
%Introductory paragraph to link to ATAC-seq data
Mapping chromatin accessibility represents an informative tool to identify regulatory elements undergoing histone modifications, DNA methylation and TF binding, as previously explained. All those elements are involved in the regulation of gene expression, making the study of chromatin accessibility a good proxy for the inference of gene expression. Nevertheless, the characterisation of the chromatin landscape also presents some limitations, including the discordance between open chromatin and functionality of the regulatory element, shown by CAGE studies, as well as the identification of the target gene regulated by a particular element. 

In order to contextualise the ATAC-seq data, qPCR gene expression analysis for 370 key genes in the inflammatory and autoimmune response was conducted in CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ cells isolated from SF and PB of three PsA patients (Table \ref{tab:PSA_datasets_per_sample}). Those appeared as the most abundant cell types in PB and SF from patients, and particularly mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ cells have been shown to expand in PsA inflammed synovium, as previously mentioned. The PCR array represented a cost-effective approach to study gene expression between PB and SF focusing in a relevant subset of genes of notably importance, given the inflammatory component in PsA. For each cell types, FC in expression was calculated pair-wise for SF respect to PB within each sample for each individual genes (detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:Mat}). Likely due to the small sample size,the majority of the modulated genes between SF and PB lacked of significance (FDR$<$0.05) after multiple testing correction. Therefore, to explore the biological relevance of this data, a less stringent pval$<$0.05 was used as the filtering threshold. 

% Since I am not used corrected pval Hai mentioned that I can not talk about differentially expressed
When considering the significantly modulated genes (pval$<$0.05) in at least one cell type, 
differences in magnitude and reproducibility in FCs were observed across samples and cell types (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_5pcnt_heatmap}). Some of the modulated genes showed up-regulation (FC$>$1.5) in SF compared to PB across the three cell types, for example \textit{FN1}, \textit{SPP1} or \textit{CCL2}, amongst others (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_5pcnt_heatmap} orange box). On the other hand, a number of genes presented reduced expression in SF (FC$<$1.5) in at least one of the three cell types, including \textit{FOS}, \textit{IL16}, \textit{PPBP} and \textit{TPST1} (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_5pcnt_heatmap} purple box). Also, a number of genes were only consistently modulated in the three CD14$^+$ monocyte samples but not in T cells (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_5pcnt_heatmap} dark blue box). 

\begin{landscape}

Each column represents a genes and each row a pair of SF-PB PsA samples. The log${_2}FC$ in gene expression between SF and PB is colour-coded. Overall, the heatmap allows to observe the change in gene expression as well as the magnitude between SF and PB for each gene in each of the the three pairs of PsA samples in CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ cells.}
\label{figure:PSA_PCR_array_5pcnt_heatmap}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

For example, \textit{CCR7} and \textit{IL7R} were up-regulated in SF CD14$^+$ monocytes compared to PB; however changes between SF and PB were not consistent across patients in mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$. Moreover, differences in the magnitude of FCs were also observed for some of the genes modulated in the same direction across the three cell types, for instance \textit{VEGFB} and \textit{CXCR6} (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_5pcnt_heatmap_New} green box).


Filtering of all the genes tested for expression in the qPCR array based statistical significance (pval$<$0.05) and abs(mean FC)$>$1.5 revealed CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD8$^+$ presenting greater number of significantly modulated genes (72 and 77, respectively) compared to mCD4$^+$ cells (46 genes) (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_vulcano_plots} a, b and c). For the three analysed cell types, the majority of modulated immune genes showed up-regulation in the SF (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_vulcano_plots} a, b and c). For example, 56 out of the 70 significantly modulated genes in CD14$^+$ monocytes showed abs(mean FC)$>$1.5 versus the 14 genes with mean FC$<$1.5 (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_vulcano_plots} a).

\subsubsection{Correlation between gene expression and chromatin accessibility}
% ATAC overall overlap
Overlap between differentially modulated genes and DARs in the proximity were observed in the three cell types (Table \ref{tab:PSA_gene_expression_ATAC_overlap}). The overlap in CD14$^+$ monocytes revealed significant enrichment of modulated genes between SF and PB for DARs with the same direction of change (Fisher exact test pval=0.028). In contrast to CD14$^+$ monocytes, the observed overlap between gene expression and chromatin accessibility did not appear to be significant in mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ cells (Fisher exact test pval=0.466 and 0.173, respectively).

\label{tab:PSA_gene_expression_ATAC_overlap}
\end{table}

In CD14$^+$ monocytes, 13 out of the 56 significantly up-regulated genes in SF overlapped with SF open DARs. For example, the increased expression of \textit{IL7R} in SF correlated with increased chromatin accessibility at the 5' and 3' UTR of this gene, previously shown (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_FAST_ATAC_gene_boy_DOCS_CD14_NK} b). Another relevant example was the \textit{FN1} gene, which up-regulated expression in synovial biopsies compared to PB has already been reported by others \parencite{Dolcino2015}. In this cohort, \textit{FN1} expression was up-regulated in SF for all three cell types with the greater FC found in CD14$^+$ monocytes (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_vulcano_plots} a), concomitantly with more accessible chromatin at the promoter and downstream the 3' UTR of the gene (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_CD14_ATAC_FN1}). Lesser overlap between up-regulated gene expression and open chromatin in SF compared to PB was observed in mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ (6 and 3 hits, respectively). Only CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD8$^+$ cells presented overlap between SF down-regulated genes and proximal less accessible in SF (2 and 1, respectively). Notably, none or very few genes presented opposite direction of change in gene expression and chromatin accessibility on a proximal DAR (4 in CD14$^+$ monocytes, 0 in mCD4$^+$ and 2 in mCD8$^+$), reinforcing the biological relevance of the observed overlaps.

\subsubsection{Pathway enrichment and network analysis highlights the role of synovial CD14$^+$ monocytes in cytokine and chemokine production}
%Describe pathway analysis results and curate the pathway of interest
To identify relevant pathways amongst the modulated genes between SF and PB, enrichment analysis was performed for each individual cell type. Up-regulated and down-regulated genes showing abs mean FC$>$1.5 and pval$<$0.05 were used as input for the enrichment analysis. Interestingly, the modulated genes between SF and PB in CD14$^+$ monocytes were enriched for chemokine, NOD-like signalling and TLR signalling pathways (Table \ref{table:PSA_PCR_array_pathway_analysis}). All three pathways are involved in the activation of cytokines and chemokines gene expression, leading to T cell recruitment and inflammatory response. 

The TLR signalling pathways enrichment involved the \textit{FN1} (previously mentioned) and \textit{SPP1}, two of the top differentially expressed genes found in this pilot study (Table \ref{table:PSA_PCR_array_pathway_analysis}). Together with \textit{FN1}, \textit{SPP1} was highly up-regulated (mean FC$>$16) in the three cell types, showing the greatest FC in monocytes (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_vulcano_plots} a). Moreover, some of the genes driving enrichment, such as \textit{CCL5} and \textit{NFKB}, were also shared across the three pathways of interest. Others genes, including \textit{TNF}, \textit{IRF7} and \textit{MYD88}, highlighted the cross-link between the NOD-like and the TLR signalling pathways. 

Accordingly, the enrichment of SF open DARs in CD14$^+$ monocytes for the NF$\kappa$B pathway is closely related to the enrichment for TLR and NOD-like signalling pathways at the transcriptomic level, since both pathways lead to the activation of the NF$\kappa$B TF  (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_ATAC_pathway_analysis_all_DOC} a). %Both, TLR and NOD-like pathways lead to the activation of the NF$\kappa$B TF, which induces transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, further supported by the enrichment of SF open DARs in the proximity of genes from the IL-2, IL-3, IL-5 and GM-CSF pathways (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_ATAC_pathway_analysis_all_DOC} a). Moreover, the pivotal role of NF$\kappa$B in the immune transcriptional profile of SF CD14$^+$ monocytes is additionally sustained at the chromatin accessibility level by the enrichment of SF accessible chromatin sites for this TF (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_TFBS}).  

The enrichment for the chemokine pathway in CD14$^+$ monocytes (Table \ref{table:PSA_PCR_array_pathway_analysis}) included modulated genes highly up-regulated (mean FC$>$16) in SF compared to PB (e.g \textit{CCL18} and \textit{CCL2}) for all three cell types (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_vulcano_plots}) as well as genes only consistently modulated between SF and PB in CD14$^+$ monocytes (e.g \textit{CCL28}, Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_5pcnt_heatmap} green box). %The chemokine pathway includes production of chemotractant molecules involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) through Ca$^2$$^+$ mobilisation, a pathway that has previously presented to be enriched in SF open DARs in CD14$^+$ monocytes (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_ATAC_pathway_analysis_all_DOC} a).

At the transcriptional level, significantly modulated genes between SF and PB in mCD4$^+$ T cells were enriched for the IL-10 signalling pathway (Table \ref{table:PSA_PCR_array_pathway_analysis}), in lines with the enrichment for IL signalling of open chromatin in SF cells (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_ATAC_pathway_analysis_all_DOC} b). % Add reference to this pathway in disease

In addition to pathway enrichment, network analysis was performed to understand the interaction and relationship of the genes with modulated expression between SF and PB. A gene subnetwork was identified from the STRING functional interaction database using as input all the genes from the qPCR array (regardless pval significance and FC) and ranking them based on the best pval across the three analysed cell types. The identified subnetwork predominantly included significant modulated genes between SF and PB in at least one of the cell types. Amongst the most interesting nodes was the single Ig and Toll-interleukine domain containing gene (\textit{SIGIRR}), which is a negative regulator of the TLR signalling pathway (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_network_analysis}). \textit{SIGIRR} was significantly down-regulated in SF CD14$^+$ monocytes only and it is consistent with the significant up-regulation (pval<0.05) of the \textit{TLR1}, \textit{TLR2}, \textit{MYD88} genes in SF as well as the enrichment for the TLR pathway in this cell type (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_5pcnt_heatmap} and \ref{table:PSA_PCR_array_pathway_analysis}). Moreover, the significant up-regulation of \textit{NFKB} and \textit{TNF} in the SF CD14$^+$ monocytes appeared as a downstream result of the functional connection with TLR pathway members such as \textit{MyD88}, previously mentioned . Conversely, in mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ the modulation of these members did not appear to be significant between SF and PB.% however, in mCD8$^+$, \textit{TNF} expression is also significantly up-regulated in the synovium compared to PB. 

Another interesting part of the network is the connection of the TLR pathway and the chemokine production through \textit{NF$\kappa$B}, \textit{TNF} and \textit{CCL2} (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_network_analysis}). \textit{CCL2} is connected to \textit{CXCL10} and subsequently with \textit{CCL18} and \textit{CCR5}, all chemokines and chemokine receptors regulating migration and infiltration of monocytes and memory T cells at the sites of inflammation. This network analysis also highlighted relationship between \textit{IL7R} and \textit{IL2RG} coding for the two chains of the IL-7R. %Interestingly, these two nodes were only significantly up-regulated in SF CD14$^+$ monocytes when compared to PB, supporting the novel cell and context specific role of IL-7R and IL-7R polymorphism under inflammatory conditions in CD14$^+$ monocytes\parencite{Al-Mossawi2018}.

Overall, the integration of the chromatin accessibility and immune transcriptional data reinforced a relevant role of synovial CD14$^+$ monocytes in the production of cytokines and chemokines, likely leading to activation of the innate immune response and the recruitment of T cells to this site of inflammation. 



\subsubsection{Tissue and disease specificity in gene expression modulation and relevant biological pathways}

In order to better understand the disease and tissue specificity of the prior transcriptomic results, gene expression was analysed in CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ isolated from PB in three healthy controls using the same qPCR array. In each of the cell types, the FC in was calculated for the mean PB expression across the three PsA patients compared to the mean expression of the three healthy controls (as detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:Mat}). Similar to the previous analysis, pvals for the FC significance were calculated for each particular genes. Integration of the previous results of modulated gene expression between SF and PB in PsA (see Immune-relevant gene expression by qPCR) with this analysis allowed the identification of three group of genes (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation}). First, the genes only significantly modulated (based on pval and FC threshold criteria) in PB between controls and PsA were designated as systemic genes (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation} green dots). Those genes were not significantly modulated in the prior analysis comparing SF versus PB within PsA patients and could then be considered as the circulating disease "footprint". In this respect, CD14$^+$ monocytes was the cell type with lower number of systemic modulated genes (14), compared to mCD8$^+$ (23) and mCD4$^+$ (42) (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation}a, b and c). Amongst these genes were \textit{CCL24} and \textit{CCL27} in CD14$^+$ monocytes, \textit{CCR7} and \textit{TLR4} in mCD4$^+$ cells and \textit{CCR10} in mCD8$^+$ cells.

The genes are colour-coded based three categories of genes built according by comparison of changes in gene modulation between the two contrasts: only significantly modulated in PB between controls and PsA (systemic genes), only significantly modulated between SF and PB in PsA patients (tissue-specific) and significantly modulated between controls and PsA patients in PB as well as between SF and PB in PsA patients (putative disease-specific).}
\label{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation}
\end{figure} 



A second group of genes were designated as tissue-specific, since they were significantly modulated between SF and PB in PsA patients but did not show significant changes between controls and PsA at the circulating level (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation} red dots). Interestingly, in CD14$^+$ monocytes the tissue specific modulated genes considerably outnumbered the systemic ones (62 versus 14), showing a more pronounced change in the expression profile of immune genes across patients' tissues than between healthy and diseased PB (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation} a red dots). For example, the aforementioned \textit{NFKB} and \textit{MYD88}, \textit{TLR2} genes were only up-regulated in PsA SF CD14$^+$ monocytes and their expression was not significantly modulated between healthy controls and PsA circulating CD14$^+$ monocytes.  Similarly to CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD8$^+$ cells also presented greater disease tissue-specific modulation than genes differentially expressed when compared to controls in PB (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation} c red dots). For all three cell types, the two genes presenting the greatest FC between SF and PB \textit{SPP1} and \textit{FN1} appeared to be tissue-specific genes and no significant changes in PB between PsA and healthy controls were identified.
%Some more biology?
% talk about limitations in acknowledging these genes as dissease-tissue specific due to the fact that we don't know if they also change between PB and Sf in HV

The third category comprised genes significantly modulated for each cell type between controls and PsA patients in PB as well as between SF and PB in PsA patients. These genes defined as putative disease-specific genes presented similar numbers across CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ (10, 9 and 8, respectively) (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation} blue dots in a, b and c). In CD14$^+$ monocytes two of those genes, \textit{GPI} and \textit{PRG2}, were up-regulated in both comparisons, with further exacerbation in SF (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation} a). Evidence of the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase \textit{GPI} up-regulation in disease has been found in RA synovial fibroblasts and linked to increased levels of TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$ in the synovium \parencite{Zhong2015}. % GPI fibroblasts https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4422595/
Another example of exacerbated up-regulation in SF was the expression of \textit{GPR68} in mCD4$^+$. This gene was up-regulated in PsA PB mCD4$^+$ when compared to the control counterparts and further up-regulated in SF when compared to PB in PsA individuals (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation} b). %\textit{GPR68} is a G protein-coupled receptor, expressed in T cells, amongst other cells, that undergoes activation through pH acidification, characteristic of synovial tissues under inflammation \parencite{Biniecka2016}. \textit{GPR68} activation leads to an increase of Ca$^2$$^+$ levels and subsequent activation of immune-related pathways \parencite{Saxena2011}. 
\textit{GPR68} was also up-regulated in SF compared to PB in mCD8$^+$ cells, reinforcing the relevance of this gene in the synovial pathophysiological aspect of PsA. Amongst the genes presenting an opposite behavior is the epidermal growth factor-like amphiregulin (\textit{AREG}), which in mCD8$^+$ is significantly up-regulated in PsA PB compared to the controls but is down-regulated in PsA individuals when comparing SF versus PB (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation} c). %\textit{AREG} deficiency in mouse models have shown an impaired immunosupressive response by Treg cells \parencite{Zaiss2013}, which could be contributing to the exacerbated immune response in the synovium.

%GPR68 Hypoxia Positively Regulates the Expression of pH-Sensing G-Protein–Coupled Receptor OGR1 (GPR68)
%talk about limitations of those genes to be identified as disease specific. This would need an additional comparison between HV SF and PsA SF to make sure that those genes are not modulated in SF of HV and therefore are a lanmark of disease in both tissues
Despite the interesting aforementioned findings, the identification of disease-specific and disease tissue-specific genes is clearly limited by the impossibility of obtaining healthy controls SF to include in the experimental design. 

When performing pathway enrichment analysis using the significantly modulated genes between healthy controls and PsA patients PB in the qPCR array, only the Reactome immune system pathway appeared as significant for CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD4$^+$ cells. This result reinforced the tissue-specificity of the pathways enriched for the modulated genes between SF and PB in CD14$^+$ monocytes PsA patients and clearly suggest a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype of the pathological CD14$^+$ monocytes in SF compared to PB.



\subsection{Characterisation of the CD14$^+$ monocyte heterogeneity in PsA using scRNA-seq}
According to the analysis of chromatin accessibility and immune-related gene expression in this pilot cohort, the CD14$^+$ monocytes showed the greatest changes in chromatin accessibility and the most reliable modulation of expression for pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines between PB and SF. Monocytes are very plastic cells which initiate differentiation into macrophages at the site of inflammation. Therefore, exploring differences at the single-cell level may identify subpopulations with particular phenotypes of interest and may also highlight differences in the immune response driven by this cell type in circulation and at the inflamed synovium.


\subsubsection{scRNA-seq reveals two main subpopulations in SF and PB combined CD14$^+$ monocytes}
%Explain how I did the analysis
ScRNA-seq was performed in paired PBMCs and SFMCs isolated from three PsA patients (Table \ref{tab:PSA_datasets_per_sample}). scRNA-seq data from each of the PBMCs and SFMCs samples, were filtered as explained in \ref{ch:Mat} and CD14$^+$ monocytes were subset from the rest of cell populations by expression of \textit{CD14} and \textit{LYZ}, two of the most accurate expression markers defining this cell population (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_scRNAseq_SF_an_PB_monocytes_identification_from_bulk} a and b). Across all six samples (three SFMCs and three PBMCs), 2,459 cells were CD14$^+$ monocytes cells, representing approximately 17\% of the bulk SFMCs and PBMCs cells included in the analysis and in line with the proportion of CD14$^+$ monocytes previously reported using cell surface markers by mass cytometry  (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_cell_composition}). The CD14$^+$ monocytes identified in each of the three  paired PBMCs-SFMCs PsA samples were combined using CCA to correct for intrinsic batch effect, unavoidable due to patient samples recruitment in different days and generation of SFMCs and PBMCs 10X libraries separately. CCA alignment of the six CD14$^+$ monocytes populations was followed by conservative unpervised clustering (using resolution 0.1) and t-SNE visualisation.

\end{figure}

%Say that using a conservative approach to find cluster two main groups were identified: No IL7R vs IL7R
%Probably more heterogeneity could be found within the big cluster but given number of replicates and intensive analysis required to make sure clusters are estable we decided to only trust these two main groups
Using this conservative approach for cluster definition, two robust clusters were identified (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_scRNAseq_SF_an_PB_monocytes_identification_from_bulk} a). The smallest cluster, named a CC-IL7R, was characterised by the expression of \textit{IL7R}, \textit{IL32} and \textit{CCL5}, amongst others, and was formed by a total of 72 cells (43 from SF versus 29 from PB) (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_scRNAseq_CC_mixed_and_IL7R_overlay_markers} b and \ref{figure:PSA_scRNAseq_CC_mixed_and_IL7R_markers_heatmap}) (\parencite{Al-Mossawi2018}, in revision). The proportion of IL7R$^+$CD14$^+$ monocytes when compared to the totalCD14$^+$ monocyte population was very similar in SF and PB (3 and 2.7\%, respectively) in this data. The largest cluster, named as CC-mixed, consisted of 2,387 (1,356 SF and 1,031 PB). CC-mixed was an heterogeneous cluster, without consistent expression pattern for those genes identified as cluster markers (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_scRNAseq_CC_mixed_and_IL7R_markers_heatmap}). When using a less conservative approach for cluster definition by increasing the resolution (resolution 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8), additional clusters were identified. Similarly to the observation in the most conservative approach, no consistency was found in the expression of the top genes defined as markers by cells of the same cluster (data not shown). Due to the moderate cohort size, limitation in accounting for batch effect for cluster identification and the complexity in the definition and identification of stable clusters this analysis could only yield limited information about monocytes subpopulations.  Increasing cohort size and a implementation of more exhaustive analysis and alternative methods could lead to identification of additional subpopulations within the combined SF and PB CD14$^+$ monocytes in the CC-mixed cluster (see \ref{Discussion_scRNAseq}). For the scope of this project, downstream analysis, including DGE between the two tissues, was performed in the CC-mixed and CC-IL7R clusters identified by the most conservative approach (resolution 0.1).




\subsubsection{Differential gene expression between SF and PB CD14$^+$ monocytes in CC-mixed and CC-IL7R}
%DGE was performed between tissues within each cluster
DGE analysis was performed in order to explore differences between SF and PB within each of these two main CD14$^+$ monocyte subpopulations. For the CC-mixed cluster, a total of 251 genes were differentially expressed at an FDR$<$0.01 and abs(FC)$>$1.5 between SF and PB, of which 149 and 102 presented up- and down-regulation, respectively (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_scRNAseq_vulcano_plots_mixed_and_IL7R_clusters} a). Differential analysis within the CC-IL7R cluster revealed a total of 37 modulated genes, with the majority (35 out of 37) up-regulated in SF compared to PB (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_scRNAseq_vulcano_plots_mixed_and_IL7R_clusters} a). Due to the low number of cells in the CC-IL7R cluster and the limited sample size (n=3), the analysis only identified as significantly differentially expressed (FDR$<$0.01) genes presenting abs(FC)$>$1.5. Out of the 37 DEGs in the CC-IL7R cluster between the two tissues, 30 were also shared by the CC-mixed cluster. The seven distinctly modulated genes in the CC-IL7R cluster included \textit{CD44} (receptor of the protein product of \textit{SPP1}), \textit{MT-CO2} or S-ribosomal protein (RPS) genes (\textit{RPS29} and \textit{RPS27}).

% Pathway analysis
Pathway enrichment analysis was performed for the significantly DEGs between SF and PB in the CC-mixed and CC-IL7R subpopulations. The DEGs in the CC-mixed cluster were significantly enriched (FDR$<$0.01) a number of pathways (Table \ref{tab:PSA_scRNAseq_CD14_DEGs_pathway_analysis} and \ref{tab:PSA_scRNAseq_CC_mixed_and_IL7R_additional_pathways}), some of them of particular pathological relevance (Table \ref{tab:PSA_scRNAseq_CD14_DEGs_pathway_analysis}). One of those pathways was for the Ag processing and presentation pathway, contributed by up-regulated expression in SF CD14$^+$ monocytes of \textit{CD74} and genes from the \textit{HLA-D} family such as \textit{HLA-DQA1} and \textit{HLA-DRB1} (Table \ref{tab:PSA_scRNAseq_CD14_DEGs_pathway_analysis}). Enrichment for IFN signalling was driven differential expression of genes such as \textit{IFI6}, \textit{IFITM3}, \textit{ISG15} and the TF \textit{STAT1}, all of them up-regulated in SF when compared to PB CD14$^+$ monocytes. Another relevant enriched pathway was the extracellular matrix and extracellular matrix-associated proteins, which involve genes of the S100 family (including \textit{S100A8}, \textit{S100A9}, \textit{S100A10}, \textit{S100A11} and S100A12, that interact with the receptor for advance glycosylation end products (RAGE) and induce production of matrix-degrading enzymes. The phagosome and lysosome formation pathway also appeared to be more active in SF CD14$^+$ monocytes, with up-regulation of genes such as \textit{CTSL}, which is involved in protein degradation in lisosomes and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Lastly, enrichment for cytokine signalling was not driven by differential expression of cytokines but was contributed by up-regulation of pro-inflammatory TFs such as \textit{STAT1}, amongst other genes. The most functionally relevant significantly enriched pathways identified for DEGs in the CC-IL7R subpopulation were common to the ones found in the CC-mixed cluster (Table \ref{tab:PSA_scRNAseq_CD14_DEGs_pathway_analysis}).

Comparison with the qPCR expression analysis revealed a modest overlap between the two assays, particularly for the DEGs in the CC-IL7R. Amongst the 72 DEGs (pval$<$0.05) detected by qPCR between SF and PB in CD14$^+$ monocytes, only 13 and 4 genes were also differentially expressed (FDR$<$0.01 and no FC threshold) in the CC-mixed and CC-IL7R clusters, respectively (Figure \ref{:figure:PsA_scRNAseq_qPCR_ATAC_correlation} a). Genes with reproducible differential expression between SF and PB by the two approaches included genes with the largest FCs in both assays, such as \textit{SSP1}, \textit{FN1}, \textit{OLR1} and \textit{S100A12}, being the direction of change also consistent for all of them. %add something about cell type specificity
%Regarding the low number of qPCR DEGs between SF and PB in total CD14$^+$ monocytes reproduced by the scRNA-seq in any of the two main clusters identified could be explained by the differences in the cell sorting (FACS versus \textit{in silico} expression markers), the low number of replicates for each assay as well as different sensitivity of the two technologies. 
The limited overlap between qPCR and scRNA-seq DEGs could also partly explain the absence of overlap between enriched pathways across the two gene expression analysis.

\subsubsection{Moderate genome-wide correlation correlation between chromatin accessibility and scRNA-seq expression in the CC-mixed cluster}
In order to determine the overall correlation between scRNA-seq expression and chromatin accessibility, comparison between the log$_2$FCs for all the expressed genes in the CC-mixed CD14$^+$ monocytes cluster and all the accessible chromatin regions in total CD14$^+$ monocytes between SF and PB was conducted (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_scRNAseq_qPCR_ATAC_correlation} b). Changes in expression and chromatin accessibility only presented a moderate correlation in this data (R=0.214, pval=2x10$^{-16}$). In the CC-mixed cluster, 64 genes out of the 251 DEGs (FDR$<$0.01 and abs(FC)$>$1.5) were proximal ($\leq5$Kb) to one or more ATAC DARs (Table \ref{tab:PSA_10X_CD14_clusters_and_ATAC_overlap}). This overlap represented an enrichment (Fisher exact test pval=1.5x10$^-3$) of CC-mixed cluster DEGs for genes in the proximity of at least one DARs in total CD14$^+$ monocytes. The majority of the overlaps corresponded to matched increase or decrease (40 and 12 genes, respectively) of gene expression and chromatin accessibility when comparing SF vs PB. However, 12 DEGs in the CC-mixed cluster showed opposite dysregulation of expression and chromatin accessibility (Table \ref{tab:PSA_10X_CD14_clusters_and_ATAC_overlap}). 

Overall, this results have shown only moderate correlation between gene expression and proximal chromatin accessibility, which may highlight causality to some extent for the dysregulation of the chromatin landscape in the alteration of gene expression between CD14$^+$ monocytes in the two tissues.

For each of the two CD14$^+$ monocytes cluster identified by scRNA-seq analysis, an overlap is defined when a gene is differentially expressed (FDR$<$0.01 and abs(FC)$>$1.5) between SF and PB and a proximal significant DAR ($\leq$5Kb) showing same or opposite direction of change is also found.}
\label{tab:PSA_10X_CD14_clusters_and_ATAC_overlap}
\end{table}


An example of a relevant DEGs in the CC-mixed cluster overlapping a proximal DAR was \textit{CCL2} (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_scRNAseq_qPCR_ATAC_correlation} b). The expression of \textit{CCL2} was shown to be significantly modulated (pval$<$0.05 and mean FC$>$1.5) between SF and PB by qPCR in CD14$^+$ monocytes only, whereas no significant changes were observed for mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ in the same data (Figure \ref{figure:PSA_PCR_array_vulcano_plots} a, b, c and Table \ref{tab:PSA_gene_expression_ATAC_overlap}). In contrast, \textit{CCR2} which is the receptor for the chemokine MCP-1 (protein product of \textit{CCL2}) appeared up-regulated in mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ cells in the same individuals, likely highlighting increased chemotaxis driven by CD14$^+$ monocytes and leading to T cell infiltration in the synovium. Consistently with the up-regulated expression of \textit{CCL2} in SF versus PB, a cell type-specific SF open DAR upstream \textit{CCL2} has also been identified by ATAC in this data (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_10X_qPCR_ATAC_CD14_CCL2}). This SF open DAR region is annotated as enhancer according to Epigenome Roadmap chromatin segmentation and overlaps a eRNA reported by FANTOM5 in CD14$^+$ monocytes. However, no eQTL or Hi-C interaction in CD14$^+$ monocytes have been reported for SNPs overlapping this DAR, lacking of additional data to determine the relationship between differential expression of \textit{CCL2} and changes in chromatin accessibility in this nearby locus. 

In terms of the pathological relevance, \textit{CCL2} did not appear up-regulated in PB CD14$^+$ monocytes when comparing PsA patients and healthy controls, being defined as one of the putative disease-specific genes in the previous analysis (Figure \ref{figure:figure:PSA_PCR_array_HC_FC_correlation} a). Similarly, Dolcino and colleagues did not report \textit{CCL2} dysregulation neither in PBMCs when comparing PsA patients and healthy controls nor when comparing synovial membrane biopsies from PsA patients versus controls \parencite{Dolcino2015}. Moreover, collaborators in University of XX have performed measurements of cytokine levels in PB and SF from ten PsA patients. High levels of MCP-1 (approximately 1,000 pg/mL) were reported in SF whereas this cytokine failed to be detected in plasma, supporting the up-regulation of \textit{CCL2} expression also at the protein level (Figure \ref{figure:ELISA_SF_PsA}). Overall, these observations suggests a tissue and cell type specific dysregulation of \textit{CCL2} expression in the CC-mixed CD14$^+$ monocytes cluster that may be related to alterations in the chromatin accessibility of an enhancer in the proximity to this gene.

Similarly to the CC-mixed results, the DEGs in the CC-IL7R cluster between SF and PB were also enriched for those genes with at least one DARs nearby (Fisher exact test pval=1.85x10$^-9$). Amongst the 22 DEGs overlapping a proximal DAR, 13 of them had correlated dysregulation of expression and chromatin accessibility only 4 presented opposite directionality in the variation of the two features (Table \ref{tab:PSA_10X_CD14_clusters_and_ATAC_overlap}).

%The biological relevance of the IL7R does not show distinct differences in gene expression between tissues and its relevance may be related to the distinctive biological function of this subset in both tissues. Seems more abundant in SF and that would make sense with the differences in the PCR array in bulk expression.



\subsection{Mass cytometry reveals active cytokine production in CD14$^+$ monocytes.}
%Maybe see if adding a figure of the clusters and the main markers to complement
Measurement of cytokine production using mass cytometry was conducted in collaboration with Dr Hussein Al-Mossawi and Dr Nicole Yager. Cytokine production by CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ cells was quantified in SF and PB following incubation with BFA for 6h. BFA blocks cytokine release and enables to measure the cell cytokine production rate in absence of any inflammatory stimuli, as previously explained in Chapter \ref{ch:Mat}.

SFMCs and PBMCs were incubated with BFA for 6h prior to identification of cell populations and quantification of cytokine expression by mass cytometry. CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ populations were defined by manual gating based expression of appropriate cell surface markers.}
\label{figure:PSA_cytof_cytokines}
\end{figure}

Mass cytometry staining for IL-8 and TNF-$\alpha$ cytokines were the two showing the best QC and therefore the most reliable quantification within each of the manually gated cell populations. TNF-$\alpha$ is released by all four cell types and IL-8 is secreted by monocytes, CD4$^+$ T cells and some subsets of CD8$^+$ T cells, making these two cytokines a representative panel for the three cell types with ATAC and qPCR array data four cell types. CD14$^+$ monocytes isolated from SF and/or PB were the only cell type with active production of IL-8 and also TNF-$\alpha$, to a lesser extent (Figure \ref{PSA_cytof_cytokines}). Measured IL-8 mean expression did not appear to be different between SF and PB CD14$^+$ monocytes. In contrast, CD14$^+$ monocytes isolated from SF presented detectable mean levels of TNF-$\alpha$, which not detected for the matched cells in PB.

The increased rate of TNF-$\alpha$ production by SF CD14$^+$ monocytes further investigated by comparing the proportion of TNF-$\alpha$ positive cells after 6h of blocked cytokine secretion in each of the two tissues. Mass cytometry expression of CD14$^+$ versus TNF-$\alpha$ demonstrated greater number of SF CD14$^+$ monocytes producing TNF$\alpha$ after 6h of BFA treatment compared to PB in all three PsA patients (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_monocytes_percentage_TNFa} a). The basal (0h) percentage of CD14$^+$ monocytes positive for TNF-$\alpha$was negligible for all three patients in both, SF and PB (Figure \ref{figure:PsA_monocytes_percentage_TNFa} b). Conversely, upon inhibition of protein transport (6h), the percentage of CD14$^+$ monocytes producing TNF-$\alpha$ experienced an increase, ranging between 2 and 11.8\%, in SF whereas the increment in PB did not reach 1\%. This trend of increased percentage of SF CD14$^+$ monocytes TNF-$\alpha$ did not reach significance likely due to the small sample size.

\subsection{Prioritisation and interpretation of PsA GWAS SNPs}

The generation of epigenetics and expression data from different cell types isolated from SF and PB aims to contribute to the general understanding of disease pathophysiology and differences between affected and non-affected tissue. Furthermore, mapping of the epigenetic landscape in different cell types isolated from clinical samples and overlaying it with GWAS associations fine-mapped credible set of SNPs may be more informative for refining the number of putative functional causal variant in no coding or intergenic GWAS associations, when compare to just integration of cell lines or healthy controls epigenetic.

\subsubsection{Bayesian fine-mapping using genotype data}

In order to further refine the PsA Immunochip GWAS signals identified by Bowes and colleagues, Bayesian fine-mapping was conducted using genotype data from 1,103 patients and 8,900 controls (PsA Immunochip UK cohort from the Bowes \textit{et al.},2015). Bowes and colleagues performed fine-mapping for some of the loci and the number of independent signals for each locus as well as the number of SNPs in each 90\% credible were provided in the supplementary material \parencite{Bowes2015}. Nevertheless \textit{de novo} fine-mapping was performed here to obtain the individual identity of each of the SNPs in the credible set and conduct further integration with the in-house chromatin accessibility data generated in SF and PB. Compared to the fine-mapping performed in Bowes \textit{et al.}, 2015, the power of the analysis here presented will be limited by a smaller sample size (only UK cohort as previously mentioned) and could be improved by incorporation of additional samples or extended collaboration with Dr Anne Barton group. 

Initially, fine-mapping was performed in thirty-six of reported loci in Bowes \textit{et al.}, all of them showing at least nominal significance in their GWAS study. As expected, Bowes study's GWAS signals with the lowest significance for the lead SNP (pval$<10^{-4}$) also showed -log${_10}ABF$ under 3 (cut off used in the analysis following \parencite{Bunt2015}) for the fine-mapping lead SNP in the association analysis and were not taken forward for the calculation of PP and credible set of SNPs.

In this analysis, fine-mapping was also unsuccessful (-log${_10}ABF<3$) in four loci previously fine-mapped by Bowes \textit{et al.} (\textit{B3GNT2}, \textit{NOS2A}, \textit{REL} and \textit{TNIP1}) highlighting the already acknowledged reduced power of the analysis performed here. Amongst the twelve loci with fine-mapping lead SNP in the association analysis passing the -log${_10}ABF\geq3$ cut-off, eight have also been successfully fine-mapped by Bowes and colleagues (Table \ref{tab:PsA_fine_mapping_summary}). For two of the loci, \textit{IL23R} and \textit{TRAF3IP2}, the same fine-mapping lead SNPs were reported by the two analysis. Regarding \textit{IL12B} locus, the second signal reported by Bowes and colleagues was also identified in this analysis by the step-wise conditional analysis performed within the fine-mapping. For the four additional fine-mapped loci reported here but not by Bowes \textit{et al.}, the fine-mapping lead SNP were in very low LD (r${^2}<0.5$) with the PsA GWAS lead SNP, suggesting identification of spurious signals or signals from other locus nearby in the association analysis (Table \ref{tab:PsA_fine_mapping_summary} labelled with $\ast$). For example, the association analysis performed for the fine-mapping of \textit{IL13} was confounded by the \textit{TYK2} signal, with no LD found between the fine-mapping and the GWAS index SNPs in the \textit{IL13} locus. Therefore, these four signals were also removed from downstream integration analysis.




\subsubsection{Integrating fine-mapped SNPs and chromatin accessibility from PsA samples}
The union of the 90\% credible sets for the eight successfully fine-mapped loci represented a total of 294 unique SNPs. These SNPs were used to perform overlap with the significant (FDR$<$0.01 and abs(FC)$>$1.5) DARs identified between SF and PB in CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$, mCD8$^+$ and NK cells. Unfortunately, none of the 294 SNPs were found to be contained by a DAR in any of these cell types. Additional overlap was performed between the SNPs from the credible set and the accessible chromatin regions (consensus peaks in each cell type master list without the additional filtering performed for the differential analysis) in each of the four cell types assayed by ATAC. The largest number of SNPs (17) was found to overlap accessible chromatin in CD14$^+$ monocytes, followed by mCD8$^+$, mCD4$^+$ and NK cells (Table \ref{tab:PSA_fine_mapping_ATAC_overlap}). Overall, the 43 unique SNPs from the 90\% credible set overlapping ATAC accessible chromatin were distributes across \textit{CSF2} (8), \textit{IL12B}(3), \textit{IL23R}(4), \textit{RUNX3}(6), \textit{STAT2}(14), \textit{TRAF3IP2}(1) and \textit{TYK2}(7) loci. A number of those SNPs were found to only overlap accessible chromatin at one particular cell type.

\caption[PsA fine-mapped SNPs from the 90\% credible sets overlapping accessible chromatin identified by ATAC in four cell types.]{\textbf{PsA fine-mapped SNPs from the 90\% credible sets overlapping accessible chromatin identified by ATAC in four cell types.} The number of SNPs in the 90\% credible set union from the eight fine-mapped loci overlapping each cell type ATAC master list are reported. Furthermore, from the overlapping SNPs those ones only found to overlap open chromatin in one cell type are indicated together with the locus where the SNP was fine-mapped.}
\label{tab:PSA_fine_mapping_ATAC_overlap}
\end{table}


The reported overlap revealed that SNPs from the fine-mapping credible set presented a significant enrichment for ATAC peaks  when compared to all others GWAS Catalogue SNPs and SNPs in LD (r$^2$=8) in all four cell types (Fisher exact test: CD14$^+$ monocytes pval=7.12x$10^{-8}$, mCD4$^+$ pval=1.69x$10^{-10}$, mCD8$^+$ pval=6.40x$10^{-9}$ and NK pval=1.86x$10^{-5}$). Notably, the GWAS Catalogue SNPs overlapping ATAC accessible regions were significantly enriched (FDR$<$0.001) for particular terms from the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) (Figure \ref{figure:GWAS_traits_enriched_for_ATAC_ML}). The EFO is a hierarchical tree-like ontology where each term represents a set of disease risk SNPs annotated to a disease trait or group of related disease traits a trait or group of related disease traits (Figure \ref{figure:GWAS_traits_enriched_for_ATAC_ML}). Enrichment for general terms (towards the root of the tree) including autoimmune diseases, rheumatic diseases and skin diseases were found across all four cell types. Disease-specific terms (amongst the branches of the tree) related to the previous general terms, such as CD and IBD, were also found to be enriched for SNPs overlapping ATAC in all four cell types. Conversely, other "branches" from more general terms, including psoriasis and MS, presented significant enrichment (FDR$<$0.001) only in CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD4$^+$ cells, respectively. Overall, this reinforced the specificity found for the overlap between GWAS Catalogue genetic variants not included in the fine-mapping credible set with accessible chromatin across the immune cell types investigated in this chapter.
%This enrichment of GWAS Catalogue SNPs overlapping mCD4$^+$ ATAC peks for MS is consistent with the key role of this cell type in the pathophysiology \parencite{Bielekova2000}.

\subsubsection{Further investigating the PsA-specific 5q31 locus}
Following fine-mapping, integration of in-house ATAC and additional functional data with the 90\% set of SNPs was conducted to further investigate the 5q31 locus, harbouring the currently only PsA-specific GWAS association not shared with psoriasis. Out of the 58 SNPs in the 90\% credible set, only 8 overlapped ATAC accessible chromatin (ATAC peaks from the different cell types master lists) in at least one of the four cell types included in this study (Figure \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} top panel). Amongst those SNPs were included the three (rs10065787, rs27437 and rs7721882) of the four variants highlighted by Bowes and colleagues as the most functionally relevant according to ENCODE epigenetics data.

\label{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL}
\end{table}

The SNP rs10065787, highlighted by Bowes \textit{et al.} for overlapping with ENCODE clusters of occupancy for TFs relevant in CD4$^+$ and CD8$^+$ biology, presented accessible chromatin in CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD4$^+$ cells, showing also moderate enrichment for the the enhancer histone mark H3K4me1 in mCD4$^+$ (Figure \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} right hand side panel red line). Similarly, the nearby SNP rs27437 overlapped an ATAC peak in CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD4$^+$ and the same TFBS site cluster than rs10065787 (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL} and Figure \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} right hand side panel green line). Rs10065787 appeared to be part of an eQTL signal for \textit{SLC22A5} and \textit{P4HA2} expression in unstimulated and stimulated monocytes (LPS2, LPS24, IFN-$\gamma$), respectively (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL}). However, no \textit{cis}eQTLs for tCD4$^+$ was reported for this SNP by the Kasela and colleagues dataset (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL}). In contrast, rs27437 was part of a \textit{cis}-eQTL in tCD4$^+$ and tCD8$^+$ associated to modulation of expression for \textit{SLC22A5}, the same eGene reported by Bowes and colleagues in their pilot eQTL study. Chromatin conformation data using promoter capture-HiC \parencite{Javierre2016} in unstimulated monocytes does not clearly reveal interaction for rs10065787 with the promoter of \textit{P4HA2} or \textit{SLC22A5}. Conversely, rs27437 is relatively close to the bait in \textit{IL3} promoter, which interacts with \textit{SLC22A5}, potentially bringing this SNP in proximity with the promoter of \textit{SLC22A5}.  


Other SNPs such as rs2089855 also appeared in an eQTL signal for \textit{P4HA2} and \textit{SLC22A5} in untreated and stimulated monocytes and associated with \textit{SLC22A5} expression in tCD4$^+$ cells (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL}). This SNP is proximal to rs11955347, which in Bowes \textit{et al.} presented the most significant correlation with expression of \textit{SLC22A5} in tCD4$^+$ and tCD8$^+$, and has also shown to be within the \textit{cis}-eQTL signal for \textit{SLC22A5} expression in unstimulated and IFN-$\gamma$ stimulated monocytes and for \textit{P4HA2} in monocytes stimulated with LPS (2 and 24h) \parencite{Fairfax2014}. The effect of rs11955347 genotype in modulation of \textit{SLC22A5} expression was also confirmed in the larger data set of Kasela \textit{et al.} in both, tCD4$^+$ and tCD8$^+$ cells. Interestingly, rs1195547. Altogether, these observations may suggest a role of the 5q31 PsA-specific GWAS association also in regulation of gene expression of \textit{P4HA2} and \textit{SLC22A5} not only in T cells but also in monocytes under different conditions.

The schema also includes the location of relevant SNPs for the 5q31 PsA-specific GWAS region from the Bowes \textit{et al.}, study, including the GWAS lead SNP (in red), the eQTL SNP showing the best correlation with the GWAS lead SNP (in green) and one SNPs from the credible set overlapping several ENCODE annotation features with no overlap for the in-house PsA ATAC data (in purple). The left and right hand side panels are a zoom in onto the the UCSC visulisation of the epigenetic landscape for rs4705908 and rs2069803 (left brown and black lines, respectively) and rs1006587 and rs27437 (right, red and green lines, respectively), which represent four of the most relevant fine-mapped SNPs at the 5q31 in terms of overlap with PsA ATAC data signal for eQTLs. For each panel, all the ATAC tracks from three PsA patients and four cell types isolated from SF and PB are included. ATAC tracks are colour-coded by tissue (SF=purple and PB=turquoise).

Another two relevant SNPs from the 90\% credible set here reported were rs2069803 and rs4705908, both overlapping ATAC peaks in all four cell types (Figure \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} left hand side panel black and brown lines, respectively). Rs4705908 is located upstream the promoter of \textit{ACSL6} gene and is overlapping a genomic location showing H3K4me1 enrichment, supporting a regulatory role for that region. Notably, rs4705908 is mapping to a CTCF binding site reported in GM12878 and LCLs cell lines. Likewise, rs2069803 is also overlapping open chromatin and moderate H3K4me1 signal in mCD4$^+$, mCD8$^+$ and NK cells (Figure \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} left hand side panel). The region has also been annotated as enhancer and weakly transcribed in mCD4$^+$, mCD8$^+$ and NK cells by the Epigenome Roadmap chromatin segmentation maps (yellow and light green in \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} left hand side panel). Although accessible chromatin has been identified at rs2069803 and rs4705908 for all cell types, \textit{cis}-eQTL for these two SNPs have only been reported in CD4$^+$ or CD8$^+$, with the genotypes of both SNPs correlating with regulation of \textit{SLC22A5} expression, with extremely high significance in tCD4$^+$ cells (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL}). Promoter capture Hi-C data in na\'{i}ve and total CD4$^+$ CD8$^+$ cells revealed interaction of the \textit{IL3} promoter bait containing rs2069803  with the promoter of \textit{SLC22A5}. Interestingly, rs4705908 appeared also within the bait of the \textit{ACSL6} promoter interacting with the \textit{IL3} promoter bait, which also includes the previously mentioned rs2069803 variant . Overall, promoter-capture HiC data revealed potential physical interaction between rs27437, rs2069803 and rs4705908 in CD4$^+$ and CD8$^+$ cells with potential functional relevance in regulation of \textit{SLC22A5} expression.

Lastly, rs7721882 was the only SNP showing a very significant eQTL effect in tCD4$^+$ for \textit{SLC22A5} expression and overlapping with a putative mCD4$^+$ cell type specific ATAC peak (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL}). However, additional replicates and greater sequencing depth would be required in order to confirm the robustness of this peak as well as the cell type specificity in mCD4$^+$ cells.  

%Promoter capture-HiC from Javierre \textit{et al.} in tCD4$^+$ and tCD8$^+$ cells revealed  direct rs743564 interaction with \textit{P4HA2} and proximity to a downstream fragment that presents frequent interaction with \textit{SLC22A5} promoter in both cell types. Interestingly, rs1469149, another SNP from the credible overlapping a mCD4$^+$-specific ATAC peak (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL}) is found to be in the same bait as rs743564 interacting with \textit{SLC22A5} promoter. The SNP rs1469149 also presents a extremely significant signal for a tCD4$^+$ eQTL regulating \textit{SLC22A5} expression and less significant eQTLs in stimulated monocytes (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL}). 


%In contrast, rs10065787 was found to be a \textit{cis}-eQTL in stimulated monocytes (LPS 2h, LPS 24h and IFN-$\gamma$) regulating \textit{P4HA2} expression (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL}). The nearby SNP rs27437 overlapped an ATAC peak in CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD4$^+$ and the same TFBS site cluster than rs10065787 (Table \ref{tab:5q31_SNPs_ATAC_eQTL} and Figure \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} right hand side panel green line). The enhancer histone mark H3K4me1 was absent in CD14$^+$ monocytes and only moderate in mCD4$^+$ (Figure \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} right hand side panel). Interestingly, \textit{cis}-eQTL were only reported for tCD4$^+$ and tCD8$^+$ associated to modulation of expression for \textit{SLC22A5}, the same eGene reported by Bowes and colleagues in their pilot eQTL study. Nevertheless, chromatin conformation data has not revealed any interaction for rs10065787 with the promoter of \textit{P4HA2}. Conversely, rs27437 is relatively close to the bait in \textit{IL3} which interacts with \textit{SLC22A5}, potentially bringing this SNP in proximity with the promoter of the eQTL eGene repoted in tCD4$^+$ and tCD8$^+$ Kasela's dataset.

%Another two relevant SNPs from the 90\% credible set here reported were rs2069803 and rs4705908, both overlapping ATAC peaks in all four cell types (Figure \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} left hand side panel black and brown lines, respectively). Rs4705908 is located upstream the promoter of \textit{ACSL6} gene and is overlapping a region enriched for H3K4me1, supporting a regulatory role for that region. Notably, rs4705908 is mapping to a CTCF binding site reported in GM12878 and LCLs cell lines. Likewise, rs2069803 is also overlapping open chromatin and moderate H3K4me1 signal in mCD4$^+$, mCD8$^+$ and NK cells (Figure \ref{figure:5q31_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} left hand side panel).

Interestingly, rs4705908 appeared also within the bait of the \textit{ACSL6} promoter interacting with the \textit{IL3} promoter bait, which also includes the rs2069803 as previously mentioned \parencite{Javierre2016}. Overall, promoter-capture HiC data revealed potential physical interaction between rs27437, rs2069803 and rs4705908 in CD4$^+$ and CD8$^8$ cells with potential functional relevance in gene expression regulation of \textit{SLC22A5}.

%The PsA GWAS lead SNP rs715285 was also contained in the credible set but was mapped to a region of closed chromatin and depleted signals for H3K4me1 and digital footprint in all four cell types. Likewise, the aforementioned eQTL SNP rs11955347 from Bowes study showing the strongest correlation with \textit{SLC22A5} expression also appeared in a region depleted for open chromatin and activating epigenetic marks, suggesting that one or more of the previously highlighted SNPs from the 90\% credible set may be responsible for the effect on gene expression regulation detected by eQTL studies for \textit{P4HA2} and \textit{SLC22A5} expression. 

In addition to epigenetic evidence, further investigation of the suitability of \textit{SLC22A5} and \textit{P4HA2}, two of the genes showing eQTLs for some of the SNPs in the 5q31 credible set, as drug targets for PsA was investigated. Dr Hai Fang has developed an algorithm named Priority Index (Pi) based on random forest to levearage genetic information in the prioritisation of putative drug targets for particular complex diseases. Interestingly, \textit{SLC22A5} appeared as the third gene in the psoriasis rank supported as eGene in several immune cell eQTLs studies, annotation by the disease ontology with related inflammatory disease terms (including CD, IBD and RA, amongs others) as well as prediction for high druggability based on protein structure data \url{http://galahad.well.ox.ac.uk:3010/pidb/discovery/PSO/SLC22A5#bookmark_details_genomic}. In contrast, \textit{P4HA2} appeared 4,172 in the rank for psoriasis, not being such a suitable putative drug target in this disease. 

\subsubsection{Overview on fine-mapping and epigenetic data integration for other loci}
In addition to the 5q31 locus (\textit{CSF2/P4HA2}), another seven loci were successfully fine-mapped in this analysis. As previously mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:Intro} and other, integration of epigentic data and fine-mapping credible set of SNPs is particularly relevant when trying to identify putative causal SNPs for GWAS signals laying in non-coding regions. An example amongst the fine-mapped loci is \textit{IL12B}, which PsA GWAS lead SNP as well as the fine-mapped lead SNP found in this analysis were located upstream this gene. Out of the 52 SNPs identified in the 90\% credible set only four appeared to overlap accessible chromatin in at least two of the cell types analysed by ATAC in PsA samples and they were not not in LD with common non-synonymous SNPs in \textit{IL12B}. The PsA GWAS SNP rs4921482 (primary signal in Bowes and colleagues) overlapped a strong ATAC peak in all cell types as well as H3K4me1 enhancer marker .However, none of the four SNPs in the credible set overlapping ATAC peaks was found within a \textit{cis}-eQTL signal in any of the explored datasets.

For another two of the loci fine-mapped in this analysis, \textit{STAT2/IL23A} and \textit{TRAF3IP2}, previous evidence for high LD between the psoriasis GWAS signal and missense coding variants in \textit{STAT2} and \textit{TRAF3IP2}, respectively, had been reported \parencite{Tsoi2012}. For the psoriasis GWAS \textit{STAT2} signal, Tsoi \textit{et al.}, 2012 highlighted a missense mutation (rs2066807)with highly predicted damaging effect in this gene and in very high LD with the GWAS lead SNP (Figure \ref{figure:STAT2_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} purple line). This SNP also appeared in the 90\% credible set of SNPs in this analysis. Although rs2066807 did not overlap ATAC accessible chromatin in any of the four cell types, it mapped to a RUNX3 and CTCF binding site in the cell lines GM12878 and K562. SNPs from the credible set located in the vicinity of this putative missense variant were found within eQTL signals of interest. For example, rs2371494 overlapped an ATAC peak in all four cell types (Figure \ref{figure:STAT2_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} black line) and presented a highly significant eQTL effect for \textit{STAT2} expression in unstimulated monocytes (FDR=7.54x10${^-31}$) and to a lesser significance under IFN-$\gamma$ stimulation (FDR=9.94x10${^-6}$). Fairfax and colleagues reported a negative effect for the major allele (G) of rs2371494 and also for the PsA GWAS lead SNP rs2020854 (T) (LD r$^2$=0.79) in both conditions, indicating increased expression of \textit{STAT2} for the GWAS risk allele. Interestingly, rs57870697 nearby and in very high LD (r${^2}\geq$0.79) with rs2371494, overlapped a CD14$^+$ monocyte specific ATAC peaks in SF and PB (Figure \ref{figure:STAT2_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} red line) but no eQTL for any gene has been reported at the location of this SNP.

%Interestingly, out of the two SNPs from the \textit{TRAIF3IP2} credible set only one was overlapping open chromatin within an exon of the gene only in CD14$^+$ monocytes. 

Lastly, fine-mapping for the \textit{RUNX3/SYF3} identified 48 SNPs in the credible set, of which six overlapped ATAC peaks in CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD8$^+$ cells and one was found mapping to a discrete mCD8$^+$ specific peak at the edge of a CTCF and RELA binding site in GM12878. Nevertheless, no eQTL has been reported for any of the six SNPs overlapping ATAC in any of the datasets.



%Fine-mapping of the PsA GWAS signal in chr2 nearby \textit{STAT2} and \textit{IL23A} genes yielded 110 SNPs in the credible set of SNPs, very similar to the size of the credible set reported by Bowes and colleagues for this locus. Out of the 110 SNPs, 8 were found to overlap with an ATAC peak in at least one cell type. Amongt those 8 SNPs, rs2371494 located upstream the \textit{IL23A} and \textit{STAT2} genes, appeared to be of particular interest. Rs2371494 overlapped an ATAC peak in all four cell types (Figure \ref{figure:STAT2_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} black line) and presented a highly significant eQTL effect for \textit{STAT2} expression in unstimulated monocytes (FDR=7.54x10${^-31}$) and to a lesser significance under IFN-$\gamma$ stimulation (FDR=9.94x10${^-6}$). Fairfax and colleagues reported a negative effect for the major allele (G) of rs2371494 and also for the PsA GWAS lead SNP rs2020854 (T) (LD r$^2$=0.79) in both conditions, indicating increased expression of \textit{STAT2} for the GWAS risk allele. Additional eQTLs with lower significance for other eGenes were also reported for rs2371494 and other SNPs in the credible set.

%Interestingly, rs35157967 and rs57870697, two SNPs of the credible set in the vicinity and in very high LD (r${^2}\geq$0.79) with rs2371494, were overlapping SF and PB CD14$^+$ monocyte specific ATAC peaks (Figure \ref{figure:STAT2_fine_mapping_SNPs_epigenetic_track} red and green lines). Rs35157967 is located upstream \textit{IL23A} and \textit{STAT2} genes and rs57870697 is found within a \textit{STAT2} intron. Both SNPs were also mapping to H3K4me1 in CD14$^+$ monocytes and ENCODE clusters for TFs. Notably, rs35157967 is overlapping binding sites for for STAT2 and IRF1 in K562 cell line. The fact that no eQTL for \textit{STAT2} gene has been reported for none of those two SNPs in the same conditions as for rs2371494 may be consequence of those two SNPs not having been imputed in Fairfax \textit{et al.} analysis. Hypothetical existence of an eQTL signal for \textit{STAT2} could suggest a functional role of rs35157967 and/or rs57870697 in the regulation of \textit{STAT2} expression in homeostasis and under IFN-$\gamma$ stimulation in CD14$^+$ monocytes. Nevertheless, the proximity of the SNPs in the credible set to coding SNPs

%In terms of dysregulation of expression in the affected tissue, scRNA-seq analysis did not detect \textit{STAT2} or any of the proximal genes as differentially expressed between SF and PB in CD14$^+$ monocytes.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Characterising chromatin accessibility in PsA}
The technological advances in the epigenetics field have allowed to map the epigenetic landscape in particular relevant immune cells isolated from PB and SF in PsA patients. The cell types included in this study (CD14, CD4, CD8 and NK) represented key players of the dysregulated innate and adaptive immune response involved in PsA pathophysiology. Particularly, expansion for mCD4 and mCD8 in the synovum from PsA patients has been described and many of the GWAS associted genes represent pivotal components in orchestrating their immune function \parencite{Taams2018}.

For the first time, mapping of chromating accessibility using ATAC revealed genome-wide differences between PB and SF in all four cell types. CD14$^+$ monocytes presented the largest number of DARs between SF and PB (23.3\% of the investigated regions). The majority of the DARs were located at intergenic and intronic regions and annotated as enhancers (weak or strong). Interestingly, DARs also enriched for eRNAs identified in each of the four relevant cell types by the FANTOM project, reinforcing the putative functional role of these changes in terms of regulation of gene expression. In this respect, the enrichment found for NK DArs in neutrophils eRNAs may be consequence of the lower sample quality for this cell type previously mentions.

Pathway enrichment analysis for the proximal genes to the DARs revealed commonalities and also differences between regions with increased accessibility in SF or PB for each of the cell types.Enrichment for open DARs in SF proximal to genes in the NF-$\kappa$B pathway was found in CD14$^+$ monocytes, consisistent with the TNF-$\alpha$ signature of PsA and the efficacy of anti-TNF therapies. Interestingly, Wnt signalling was enriched for DARs open in PB such as \textit{SMAD3}. Wnt signalling is involved in many biological processes and its dysregulation is associated to a number of autoimmune diseases, such as RA \parencite{Miao2013}. In this case, the increased chromatin accessibility nearby Wnt signalling genes in PB mCD8$^+$ cells may be related to an increased recall proliferation capacity of the circulating cells compare to the tissue-resident memory cells \parencite{Boudousquie2014}. In NK cells, the enrichment of DARs open in PB for gene members of the NK-mediated cytotoxicity pathway was consistent with the reduced proportion of CD56$^{bright}$ found by mass cytometry in PB in the PsA patients processed for ATAC. NK CD56$^{bright}$ resident at sites of inflammation have been described be more specialised for cytokine production than cytotoxicity \parencite{Michel2016}.

Overall, this approach has identified robust differences in chromatin accessibility between SF and PB in relevant immune cells isolated from PsA patients. Although these differences suggest some meaningful functional differences, some of the limitations of performing pathway analysis in ATAC is linking putative regulatory regions to genes. Annotation of ATAC peaks with genes in the proximity has been widely used in the literature \parencite{Scharer2016,Ackermann2016, Corces2016,Wang2018}. This approach does not take into account long range interactions and assumes accessible chromatin to regulate expression of the nearest region. Moreover, accessible chromatin is not a definitive marker for regulatory regions and mapping of histone marks such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac together with eRNas quantification will help to refine the functional relevance of the identified DARs.   
   

\subsection{Biological insights in the integration of chromatin accessibility, gene expression and proteomics data in PsA}


\subsubsection{Chromatin accessibility landscape and bulk gene expression profiling in paired samples}

Alike for chromatin accessibility profiling, more research has been conducted in characterising the transcriptional profile of PBMCs from PsA samples and compare it to healthy volunteers. Some studies have also included synovial membrane biopsies from PsA patients and controls \parencite{Dolcino2015}. 

This thesis has conducted a pilot study characterising the transcriptomic profile for relevant immune genes in CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ cells isolated from SF and PB paired to the chromatin accessibility characterisation by ATAC. In this pilot analysis (n=3) CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD8$^+$ presented the largest number of consistently modulated genes between SF and PB. Interestingly, for all three cell types the two most differentially expressed genes between SF and PB were \textit{SPP1} and \textit{FN1}, two of the top 196 DEGs in Dolcino's study when comparing synovial membranes from PsA patients versus healthy individuals (post-traumatic surgery). This observation suggest that many cell types contributing towards the up-regulated expression of these genes at the site of inflammation. \textit{SPP1} known as osteopontin is a cytokine and chemokine expressed by many cell types (including monocytes/macrophages) and involved in cell migration, adhesion and cell-mediated immune response through regulation of T cells and particularly in Th-17 \parencite{Morimoto2010}. \textit{SPP1} has also been described to play a role in other chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases \parencite{Rittling2015}. On the other hand, fibronectin-1 \textit{FN1} gene is one of the components of the cartilage matrix, involved in cell adhesion, migration, growth and differentiation and highly expressed in RA inflamed synovium \parencite{Chang2005}. Other highly DEGs in Dolcino \textit{et al.} study including \textit{TNFA}, \textit{CXCL13} or \textit{CCL18} were found also to be modulated between SF and PB at least one of the cell types. Consistently with their role in Th-17 cell biology, \textit{CXCL13} and \textit{IL26} only appeared significantly up-regulated in SF mCD4$^+$ and/or mCD8$^+$ cells but not in CD14$^+$ monocytes \parencite{Takagi2008}.

Integration of paired-ATAC data from the same PsA patients in CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ showed some overlap between genes with modulated expression between SF and PB nearby DARs presenting changes in chromatin accessibility in the same direction. Some of DARs nearby genes with significant modulated expression between SF and PB had also been identified a eRNAs in the CD14$^+$ monocytes (\textit{CCL2}, \textit{NFKB1}) or mCD4$^+$ cells (\textit{CCR6}), reinforcing the functional relevance the differences in chromatin accessibility previously identified. 

Pathway analysis for those genes consistently modulated between SF and PB in each cell type in this pilot data revealed enrichment for TLR, NOD-like and chemokine signalling in CD14$^+$ monocytes. Cross-talk between the TLR and NOD-like signalling pathways is well known and was clearly highlighted in this data through network analysis. TLR and NOD-like receptors have been identified to be relevant for rheumatic diseases, and some studies in PsA have revealed increased expression of \textit{TLR2} and \textit{TLR4} in immature DCs and CD4$^+$ cells, respectively \parencite{Candia2007,Raffeiner2005}. In this data up-regulated expression of \textit{TLR1} and \textit{TLR2}appeared to be significant in SF CD14$^+$ monocytes but \textit{TLR4} failed to reach significance in this pilot data. Interestingly, the transcritomic analysis in lesional and involved skin presented in Chapter \ref{ch:Results2} also highlighted the role of NOD-like signalling in the inflammatory response at involved tissue. TLR and NOD-like signalling pathways lead to activation of the NF$\kappa$B TF and subsequent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines \parencite{Mitchell2010}.This observation related to the enrichment of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway for DARs open in SF as well as for the up-regulated expression of \textit{TNFA} and chemokines such as \textit{CCL2} and \textit{CCL5} also up-regulated in SF CD14$^+$ monocytes, which are dependent on NF-$\kappaB$ transcriptional activation. Moreover, TFBS enrichment analysis (data not shown) revealed enrichment for NF-$\kappa$B binding motifs within CD14$^+$ monocytes DARs open in SF 

The enrichment of chemokine signalling at the transcriptional level in CD14$^+$ monocytes was also closely related to the increased transcript levels in SF of these chemotractant molecules, involved in the recruitment of T cells to the site of inflammation, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) which exert their function through Ca$^{2^+}$ mobilisation, one of the pathways enriched for DARs open in SF open in CD14$^+$ monocytes.

The enrichment of modulated genes between SF and PB for members of IL-10 signalling in mCD4$^+$ cells was of particular interest. Flow cytometry data in matched PBMCs and SFMCs from the same three patients has revealed an expansion of Tregs in SF compared to PB (data not shown), which are characterised by expression of this anti-inflammatory cytokine. qPCR in this pilot data revealed significant increased expression of the IL-10 receptor subunit \textit{IL10RA} in SF mCD4$^+$ and a trend (not statistically significant in this data) towards increased expression of \textit{IL10} for all three cell types in SF compared to PB. This could suggest a refractory effect for IL-10 signalling in SF or a counterbalance of IL-10immunosupressive effects by the immunostimulatory properties hypothesised as one of the reasons for failure of IL-10 agonist therapy in CD \parencite{Marlow2013}. An example of a potentially interesting systemic gene in mCD4$^+$ cells was \textit{CXCL1}, which did not show to be modulated between SF and PB in PsA patients. This chemokine

Integration of gene expression contrast between cell types isolated from PB in healthy controls with the previous cross-tissue comparison within matched PsA samples from SF and PB led to an exploratory definition of systemic, tissue-specific and putative-disease specific modulated genes. 

In the pilot study conducted in this thesis, CD14$^+$ monocytes and mCD8$^+$ presented a larger number of genes modulated between SF and PB in PsA patients only (tissue-specific genes) than genes changing only expression in PB when comparing PsA versus control samples (systemic genes). Interestingly, \textit{CCR10} gene was one of the systemic genes for mCD8$^+$ cells. This chemokine receptor is co-expressed by subset of memory cell which preferentially migrate to skin, and has also been identified as an up-regulated gene in tCD8$^+$ cells in the psoriasis cohort (Chapter \ref{ch:Results1} and in patients with atopic dermatitis \parencite{Hijnen2005}. Interestingly, the top two modulated genes \textit{SPP1} and \textit{FN1} appeared to be in the category of tissue-specific genes in all three cell types. \textit{FN1} up-regulation was also reported by Dolcino \textit{et al.} only when comparing synovial membranes of PsA versus controls but no changes were reported in blood, reinforcing the tissue-specificity of this dysregulation in PsA. Notably, in CD14$^+$ monocytes, two DARs open in SF were found in the proximity of \textit{FN1}, being one of them at the promoter of the gene and linking the modulation of gene expression to changes in chromatin accessibility. Conversely, Dolcino observed also moderate up-regulation of \textit{SPP1} expression in PB from PsA patients compared to controls. Since Dolcino's study was performed in bulk PBMCs, the up-regulation reported could be driven by other cells and our pilot data may suggest the tissue-specificity for \textit{SPP1} dysregulation in CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ cells. Regarding putative-tissue specific genes, \textit{GPR68} was of particular interest showing up-regulation in mCD4$^+$ PsA PB compared to controls which was further exacerbated in SF. \textit{GPR68} is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), expressed in T cells, amongst other cells, that undergoes activation through pH acidification, characteristic of synovial tissues under inflammation, yielding to increased Ca$^2$$^+$ levels and subsequent activation of immune-related pathways \parencite{Biniecka2016, Saxena2011}. Interestingly, \textit{GPR65}, another member of the GPCR family, has been associated with a number of immune mediated diseases, including AS, CD and MS \parencite{Cortes2013,Lassen2016,Wirasinha2018}.


%Maybe move to limitations
Defining the disease-specific genes for each cell type has the limitation of not being able to analyse the transcriptional profile in the same cell populations from SF of healthy controls. Therefore, further analysis using the list of genes of each category has not been performed. To increase the confidence in the identification of each category incorporation of PB and SF samples from other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as RA, a larger sample size and genome-wide transcriptional profiles with RNA-seq would allow a more exhaustive analysis to identify PsA-specific gene signature in PB and SF. 

%Highlight of the paper
Assessment of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in SF and PB in this pilot study yielded the larger number of DARs and confidently modulated genes in CD14$^+$ monocytes. Although for all three cell types modulated genes between SF and PB proximal to a DAR with the same direction of change were found, enrichment analysis demonstrated statistical significance of these overlaps only in CD14$^+$ monocytes. Since this multi-omics PsA pilot study has been a collaborative effort, in light of thesis and the results presented for the cohort size available at the time of performing data analysis, CD14$^+$ monocytes were chosen as the cell type to further explore by scRNA-seq and further integrate with mass cytometry data. Nevertheless, interesting finding regarding the SF mCD8$^+$ population have been made in terms of TCR clonality. Notably, 
 
This does not mean CD8 are not important and actually additional work is being done from other perspectives to study clonality -->Interest of CD8 clonality paper and that work is being done by other part of the team




\subsubsection{Further characterisation of CD14$^+$ monocytes by scRNA-seq and mass cytometry}

In this thesis a pilot exploratory approach was conducted to further characterise the monocyte populations in SF and PB. Monocytes are very plastic cell populations that undergo cell differentiation at the site of inflammation and these differences may be better captured at the single-cell level. A conservative approach for cluster definition in the combined SF and PB CD14$^+$ monocytes revealed a big heterogenous subset (CC-mixed) and a more discrete population (CC-IL7R) characterised by expression of the \textit{IL7R} and \textit{IL32}. Further sub-population identification within the CC-mixed cluster entailed limitations that will be further commented in \ref{Discussion_scRNAseq}. ScRNA-seq data revealed similar number of SF and PB monocytes contributing to the CC-IL7R cluster (3 and 2.7\%, respectively) in contrast to flow cytometry data from the same three PsA patients, which revealed approximately 35\% of the total SF CD14$^+$ monocyte population to be IL7R$^+$ (in revision \parencite{Al-Mossawi2018}). This is not an unexpected observation given well characterised dicrepancies between gene expression and protein translation but may also be a consequence of lower sensitivity of scRNA-seq to quantify gene expression, as only 20\% of the transcriptome of a cell is reverse-transcribed \parencite{Liu2016,Islam2014}. Thus definition of the IL7R$^+$ cluster may be incomplete using scRNA-seq transcript quantification supporting a larger population of IL7R expressing CD14$^+$ monocytes and the observed differences in bulk gene expression and chromatin accessibility at the 5' and 3'UTR of this gene between SF and PB CD14$^+$ monocytes. Nevertheless, evidence of low percentage of cell contributing to significant differences in bulk expression have also been reported \parencite{}.

Differential gene expression analysis between SF and PB revealed a greater numbers of dysregulated genes (251) in the CC_mixed cluster compared to the CC-IL7R monocyte cluster (37), consistently with the lower number of cells accounting for this last one. The majority of DEGs between tissues in the CC-IL7R cluster (30 out of 37) were found differentially expressed in the CC-mixed cluster, not suggesting cluster specific differences between tissues for the CC-IL7R subpopulation. One of the seven DEGs in the CC-IL7R cluster not overlapping the identified in the CC-mixed was \textit{CD44}, a receptor of hialuronic acid and osteopontin. Although \textit{SPP1} is up-regulated in SF compared to PB  in the CC-mixed and CC-IL7R clusters, SF monocytes from the CC-IL7R subpopulation may be more responsive to this chemokine.


This was also consistent with  the overlapping pathway with the cc-mixed cluster

Pathway enrichment analysis for the DEGs between SF and PB in the CC-mixed cluster identified a number of significantly enriched relevant biological pathways including MHC-II Ag processing, IFN signalling and extracellular-matrix components, amongst others. Interestingly, up-regulation of \textit{IFI6} and \textit{IFITM3}, two of the genes contributing to the enrichment of this pathway have also been identified as markers of a subpopulation of IFN-$\gamma$ activated monocytes in from RA synovial tissue using scRNA-seq \parencite{Zhang2018}. Genes enriched for the extracellular-matrix pathway included members of the S100 protein family, previously reported to be dysregulated in lesional skin from psoriasis patients (Chapter \ref{ch:Results2}), which are also involved in joint erosion and development of arthritis \parencite{Raghunatha2012}. Two genes of this family, \textit{S100A8} and \textit{S100A9}, were up-regulated in lesional skin compared to uninvolved, whereas they are down-regulated in SF CC-mixed monocytes in this data.
