\section{Ethical approval and recruitment of study participants}
Sample recruitment for psoriasis, PsA and the healthy volunteers were conducted under different ethics.


\subsection{Psoriasis patient recruitment}

Patient blood samples and normal or psoriatic skin biopsies were collected in collaboration with Professor Graham Ogg at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, and the Dermatology Department research nurses at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust under approval from the Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee (REC 14/SC/0106 and REC 14/NW/1153). After written informed consent, up to 60mL of blood from eligible psoriasis patients were collected into 10mL anticoagulant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing blood tubes (Vacutainer System, Becton Dickson).

Psoriasis patients were eligible for recruitment when meeting the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
  \item over 18 years old
  \item previously or newly diagnose and in a flare % check with Graham
	\item fulfillment of the clinically accepted Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) classification for psoriasis diagnosis \parencite{Fredriksson1978}
	\item moderate to severe disease (PASI>5) % check with Graham
	\item na\"{i}ve for biological therapy
	\item less than 2 weeks without antibiotics unless used for prophylaxis % check with Graham or research nurses
	\item available clinical information and written consent
\end{itemize}

Detailed clinical information of the psoriasis cohort is included in Chapter \ref{ch:Results2} Table \ref{tab:Psoriasis_cohort_metadata}.



\subsection{PsA patient recruitment}

Sample recruitment was performed as part of the Immune Function in Inflammatory Arthritis (IFIA) study established in 2006 (REC/06/Q1606/139)in collaboration with Dr Hussein Al-Mossawi at the Botnar Research Centre and research nurses at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust. Following informed written consent, approximately 30mL of blood and synovial fluid aspirate (variable upon disease severity) were recruited into 10mL anticoagulant sodium heparin coated tubes (Vacutainer System, Becton Dickson).

Eligibility of the PsA patients was upon fulfillment of the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
  \item over 18 years old
  \item previously or newly diagnose, with concomitant psoriasis and in a flare
	\item fulfillment of the clinically accepted PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) including a physician global assessment questionnaire \parencite{Philipp2011,Clegg1996}
	\item oligoarticular phenotype and na\"{i}ve for any treatment %PsA1505 had MTX in the past
	\item less than 2 weeks without antibiotics unless used for prophylaxis % check with Hussein
	\item available clinical information and written consent
\end{itemize}

Further details about the cohort and clinical information can be found in Chapter \ref{ch:Results3} Table \ref{tab:PSA_cohort_metadata}.

\subsection{Healthy volunteer recruitment}
Recruitment of healthy volunteers was conducted as part of the study Genetic Diversity and Gene Expression in White Blood Cells with approval from the Oxford Research Ethics Committee (REC 06/Q1605/55). Up to 80mL of blood were collected into 10mL anticoagulant EDTA-containing blood tubes, similarly to the psoriasis sample recruitment.

The criteria for healthy individuals to participate in the study was:
\begin{itemize}
  \item over 18 years old and preferably British or European
  \item no family history of psoriasis, PsA, RA or SpA
	\item matched sex and age with the psoriasis cohort
	\item less than 2 weeks since last infectious process
	\item written consent
\end{itemize}


\section{Sample processing}
\label{sample_processing}
Blood, synovial fluid and skin biopsies were processed straight after recruitment following the appropriate protocols.

\subsection{PBMCs and synovial fluid cells isolation}
PBMCs were isolated from blood samples through density gradient separation using Ficoll-Paque. Total synovial fluid (SF) mononuclear cells (SFMCs) were isolated by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min in absence of density gradient. Both were washed twice in Hank’s balanced salt solution without calcium or magnesium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and resuspended in phosphate saline buffer (PBS, Gibco) supplemented with 0.5\% fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen) and 2mM EDTA (Sigma), prior to separation of the different cell types. Cell numbers and viability were determined by manual count using a haemocytometer and trypan blue (Sigma) for dead/live staining.


\subsection{Skin biopsies processing and adherent assay}
KCs enrichment from skin biopsies was performed as described in Gutowska-Owsiak and colleagues \parencite{Gutowska‐Owsiak2012}. Skin biopsies (approximately 4mm) were washed with PBS, cut in 1mm width strips and incubated in 2U/mL of dispase II (Sigma) overnight at 4$^\circ$C. The epidermis was separated from the dermis and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen when used for RNA extraction. When used for chromatin accessibility assay (any ATAC-seq protocol), the epidermis was further digested in trypsin (Invitrogen) at 37$^\circ$C for 5 min to obtain a cell suspension. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 70$\micro$m nylon strainer (BD) and washed with PBS. In some instances cells were manually counted and aliquoted for ATAC-seq processing. In others, cell from each of the biopsies were resuspended in KGM-2 BulletKit (Lonza) supplemented with 0.06mM Ca$^2{+}$ and cultured in a collagen IV coated 96-well plate at 37{$^\circ$}C 5\% CO$_2$ for 10 min or 3 hours, upon experimental requirements (see Chapter \ref{Results1}). After culture, cells in the 96-well plate were washed twice with 200$\micro$L of PBS and kept at 37{$^\circ$}C for downstream processing.



\subsection{Cryopreservation and cell culture}

For the controls samples in Chapter 3, 40-50x10$^6$ PBMCs were freeze-thaw using a modified version of the \parencite{Kent2009} protocol, where cells were pre-conditioned in RPMI 1640 complete medium (Lonza) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 100U penicillin and streptomycin 100$\micro$g/mL (Sigma) and 50\% FCS for 30 minutes and, afterwards, diluted 1 in 2 in complete RPMI 1640 (supplemented as previously described) with 20\% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma). PBMCs followed slow cryopreservation at -80{$^\circ$}C in isopropanol at -1{$^\circ$}C per minute and stored for a minimum of two weeks in liquid nitrogen. PBMCs were thaw, resuspended in supplemented complete RPMI 1640 with 10\% FCS at a density of 10$^6$ cells/mL and rested for 30 min at 37°C, 5\% CO$_2$ in 25mL non-adherent polypropylene cell culture flasks followed by filtering through a 40$\micro$m cell strainer to obtain an homogenous cell suspension for FACS separation.
%
Cryopreserved Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in passage 3 were recovered and cultured at a cell density of 5x10$^6$ cells/mL in a 75 mL adherent cell culture flask (brand) in EpiLife basal medium (Gibco) following manufacturer's instructions. After recovery NHEK were trypsinised at room temperature for 8 minutes followed by trypsin inactivation with EpiLife 10\% FCS, centrifugation at 180g for 10 min at room temperature and manual counting with using trypan blue as dead/live staining. NHEKs were seeded in a 96-well plate in 100uL of medium at a cell density of 160 cells/$\micro$L and cultured for 2 days at 37°C, 5\% CO$_2$ to reach 90-100\% confluence before being used downstream for chromatin accessibility assay.

\subsection{Primary cell isolation using magnetic-activated cell sorting}
For the work related to psoriasis and matched healthy volunteers, primary cell subpopulations were separated using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS, Miltenyi) following the manufacturer's instructions. Consecutive positive selection was performed for CD19$^+$, CD8$^+$, CD14$^+$  monocytes and CD4$^+$ cells using AutoMACS Pro (Miltenyi) and followed by manual cell count, as previously described. MACS separation was chosen over Fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS) due to time and logistic constrains in the sample processing and therefore cell numbers in down stream application may not be as exact.

\subsection{Primary cell isolation using fluorescence-activated cell sorting}
Isolation of cell subpopulations from the healthy control blood samples to study the effect of cryopreservation in the chromatin landscape (Chapter \ref{ch:Results1}) and blood and SF from PsA patients (Chapter \ref{ch:Results3} was performed by FACS. PBMCs and SFMCs were resuspended in 1mM EDTA PBS (FACS buffer) at 10x10$^6$ cells/mL, stained with the appropriate antibody cocktail (Table \ref{tab:FACS_antibodies}) for 30 min at 4{$^\circ$}C, washed with FACS buffer and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4{$^\circ$}C. For the cell separation in the Chapter 3 samples, a modified FACS buffer supplemented with 3mM EDTA , 2\% FCS and 25mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, Invitrogen) was used to avoid cell clumping after cryopreservation and short recovery in culture (as detailed previously). After removing the supernatant, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer prior to separation. 

From the control samples of Chapter 3, CD14$^{+}$ monocytes and CD3$^+$ CD14$^{-}$ CD4$^{+}$ T cells were isolated using the SONY SH800 cell sorter. For the PsA samples, separation of  CD19$^+$ B cells, memory T cells (CD3$^+$ CD14$^-$ CD4$^+$ CD45RA$^{-}$ and CD3$^+$ CD14$^-$ CD8$^+$ CD45RA$^-$), CD14$^+$ monocytes and CD56$^+$ NK from PBMCs and SFMCs was performed using FACS Aria (BD) cell sorter . Sorted cells were collected in 1.5mL tubes in PBS 1\% FCS when used for ATAC-seq or only PBS when processed for scRNA-seq to avoid potential RNAse contamination. OneComp eBeads (eBioscience) were used for compensation of fluorescence spill over.

\section{Experimental protocols}
\subsection{ATAC-seq, Fast-ATAC and Omni-ATAC}
Three different versions of the ATAC-seq protocol were progressively used in this thesis for assessment of chromatin accessibility in different primary cells, including CD14$^{+}$ monocytes, CD4$^+$ and CD8$^+$ T cells, CD19$^+$ B cells and CD56$^+$ NK cells, as well as in epidermal KCs isolated from skin biopsies. Fast-ATAC and Omni-ATAC were the two subsequent versions following the standard ATAC-seq protocol from \parencite{Buenrostro2013}, aiming to reduce the amount of mitochondrial DNA in the sequencing libraries and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the original protocol.

When using MACS separation, primary cells were manually counted, as specified above, and resuspended in PBS 1\% FCS. Due to reduced accuracy of manual cell counting compared to FACS sorting, the number of cells aimed for the different ATAC-seq protocols were approximated.

\subsubsection{Standard ATAC-seq}

Standard ATAC-seq was used to generate data from skin biopsies (Chapter \ref{Results1}), healthy volunteers to test the effect of cryopreservation in the chromatin landscape (Chapter \ref{Results1}) and cohort 1A primary immune cells isolated from blood of psoriasis and control samples (Chapter \ref{Results2}). ATAC-seq was performed using an estimated number of 50,000 cells as described in Buenrostro \textit{et al.}, 2013 with minor modifications. In brief, cells were washed in 200$\micro$L of cold PBS, centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4$^\circ$C to remove the supernatant and lysed for 10 min in a buffer containing NP-40 detergent (Sigma). After lysis, the nuclei were transposed using the Nextera Tn5 transposase (Illumina) for 40 min at 37{$^\circ$}C and DNA was purified with the PCR MinElute kit (Qigen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Additional modifications and performance of the protocol in 96-well plates were implemented when processing KCs isolated from skin biopsies (as later detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:Results1}). Appropriate assessment of the approximate required number of qPCR cycles to amplify the transposed DNA following purification was tested in a set of pilot samples and the optimal number was determined to be 11 cycles. As a result, all transposed samples were simultaneously amplified and singled indexed for 11 PCR cycles using modified Nextera primers from Buenrostro \textit{et al.},2013. The resulting DNA libraries were purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and a 1.8X (v/v) of Agencourt AMPure XP Magentic Beads (Beckman Coulter) to remove the remaining adaptors and primer dimers.

\subsubsection{Fast-ATAC}
Following the Nature Methods publication of Corces et al., 2016, the  initial ATAC-seq protocol was replaced by a modified version named Fast-ATAC. It was specifically optimised for hematopoietic cells and combined cell lysis and transposition in a single step. In this thesis, Fast-ATAC was performed in skin biopsies (Chapter \ref{Results1}), cohort 1A primary immune cells isolated from blood of psoriasis and control samples (Chapter \ref{Results2}) and primary immune cells isolated from blood and SF of PsA patients (Chapter \ref{Results3}). Fast-ATAC was conducted as described by Corces et al., 2016 with minor modifications. Following the advice from Corces and colleagues, 20,000 cells were recommended as the optimal number of cells to use for Fast-ATAC, since they manifested to be the upper limit for which they have confidently generated good quality data with this particular variation of the protocol. Therefore, approximately 20,000 cells (MACS or FACS sorted) were washed with 200$\micro$L of PBS, centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4$^\circ$C and incubated in the lysis/transposition buffer containing digitonin (Roche) for 30 min at 37{$^\circ$}C and agitation at 400rpm, as specified in \parencite{Corces2016}. Following transposition, DNA was purified as in ATAC-seq and libraries were generated following 13 cycles of PCR amplification after appropriate cell cycle determination in a pilot set of samples. Purification following PCR was performed this time only with 1.8X (v/v) Agencourt AMPure XP Magentic Beads.

\subsubsection{Omni-ATAC}
Omni-ATAC, a third generation of ATAC-seq was published by \parencite{Corces2017}. Omni-ATAC was performed in 50,000 NHEKS manually counted (Chapter \ref{Results1}). Omni-ATAC is a universal protocol, optimised to be implemented in any cell type, which includes independent steps for cell lysis and transposition reactions, similarly to the standard ATAC-seq protocol. In this protocol, a gentle cell lysis (using NP40, 
Tween-20 (Sigma) and digitonin) is followed by a washing step in a buffer containing Tween-20 to remove mitochondrial DNA and other cell debri prior to the transposition step, maximising signal and minimising off-target DNA contamination. NHEKs transposed DNA was simultanously amplified and indexed, as detailed in the ATAC-seq standard protocol, for x???? PCR cycles and purified using 1.8X (v/v) Agencourt AMPure XP Magentic Beads. 


\subsubsection{Quality control and sequencing}
Following either of the three protocols, the tagmentation profiles for the amplified and purified DNA libraries were assessed with the D1000 high sensitivity DNA tape (Agilent) as part of the quality control. Quantification of the library concentration was performed using Kapa kit (Roche), following the manufacturer's instructions. Pools of 12 to 16 libraries were sequenced in one to 3 lanes of the HiSeq4000 Illumina platform by the Oxford Genomics Centre at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics aiming for approximately 50 million paired-end reads.


\subsection{Chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing library preparation by Tn5 transposase}
The H3K27ac histone mark (active enhancer and promoter marker) was assayed in four cells types (CD14$^+$ monocytes, total CD4$^+$, total CD8$^+$ and CD19$^+$) isolated from four psoriasis patients and age matched healthy volunteers (Cohort 1B, Chapter \ref{ch:Results2} Table \ref{tab:Psoriasis_cohort_metadata} and \ref{tab:Control_cohort_metadata}) using a low cell input chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocol know as ChIPmentation (ChIPm)\parencite{Schmidl2015}. For each sample, H3K27ac modifications were assayed using chromatin isolated from 100,000 cells following the protocol published by Schmidl and colleagues with some modifications. 

Aliquots of 600,000 cells of MACS sorted cell types, as described in \ref{sample_processing}, were fixed with 1\% formaldehyde (Sigma) and snap frozen in dry ice and ethanol prior to storage at -80{$^\circ$}C. Each of the  aliquots containing 600,000 fixed cells cells was resuspended in 130$\micro$L of SDS lysis buffer (Table\ref{tab:ChIPm_buffers}), sonicated for 8 min using Covaris M220(Covaris) with a duty factor of 5\% and aliquoted for single ChIPm reactions prior to long term storage at -80{$^\circ$}C. Sonicated chromatin aliquots were thawed and 1.5 volumes of ChIP equilibration buffer (Table\ref{tab:ChIPm_buffers}) were added in order to reduce the SDS concentration to 0.1\% and increase the concentration of NaCl and Triton-X100 appropriately. For the immunoprecipitation step, samples were incubated with 1$\micro$g of the Diagenode antibody (C15410196) overnight in rotation at 4{$^\circ$}C. In parallel, protein-A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were washed in beads wash buffer (Table\ref{tab:ChIPm_buffers}) and blocked with yeast tRNA (Ambion) and BSA (NEB) overnight in rotation at 4{$^\circ$}C. After overnight incubation, protein-A Dynabeads were added to the sample-antibody mix for further incubation. After appropriate washes, tagmentation was performed on the bead-antibody bound crosslinked complexes, which prevents overtagmentation of the DNA. Tagmentation was followed by protein K digestion, reverse crosslinking, elution of the DNA from the beads and purification using PCR MinElute kit. For each sample, an aliquot of chromatin was used as negative control (input) and processed in parallel without incubation with the anti-H3K27ac Ab and tagmentation was performed in 1ng of material.

Amplification by qPCR was performed in each of the samples and control inputs to determine the appropriate number of full cycles required to reach one-third of the final fluorescence. Libraries were amplified for the number of cycles minus one determined with this strategy to minimise the total number of PCR replicates and simultaneously doubled indexed using the primers optimised by \parencite{Buenrostro2015}.

\subsection{RNA extraction and gene expression quantification}

\subsubsection{RNA extraction}
Following MACS isolation of the different cell types from the psoriasis and matched healthy control samples, between 2-3x10$^6$ cells were resuspended in 350$\micro$L of RNAProtect (Qiagen) or RLT buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with 0.1\% of beta-mercaptoethanol (BM, Sigma) and snap frozen in dry ice before storage at -80{$^\circ$}C. Cells isolated from Cohort 1A psoriasis and control samples (Chapter \ref{ch:Results2} Table \ref{tab:Psoriasis_cohort_metadata} and \ref{tab:Control_cohort_metadata}) were preserved in RNAProtect, which stops any biochemical reaction and transcriptional activity maintaining cell integrity. At early stages of the project, the time frame to process the acquired samples was uncertain and RNAProtect was chosen as the most appropriate strategy to preserve cells for future RNA extraction to guarantee high quality in case storage exceeded 6 months. In the psoriasis and control samples from Cohort 1B (Chapter \ref{ch:Results2} Table \ref{tab:Psoriasis_cohort_metadata} and \ref{tab:Control_cohort_metadata}) and PsA samples (Chapter \ref{ch:Results3}), cells were resuspended in 0.1\% BM supplemented RLT buffer, which lysates cells and prevents RNA degradation. . When starting from RNAProtect preserved material, cells were centrifuged at 300g for 10 min at room temperature, the supernatant were removed and the pellets were resuspended in 350$\micro$L of RLT 0.1\% BM buffer. All cell lysates were homogonised using the QIAshredder (Qiagen) prior to RNA extraction.

Total RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/mRNA/microRNA Universal kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA extractions were performed in batches of 12 samples, including all cell types from each individual processed and a balanced numbers of psoriasis and control samples, to minimise batch effect correlating with phenotype. Basic quantification was performed with NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific) before storage at -80{$^\circ$}C.


\subsubsection{RNA-seq}
RNA-seq quality control (QC), quantification, library preparation and sequencing were carried out by Oxford Genomics Centre at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in two independent batches of samples, each including Cohort 1A or Cohort 1B, respectively. Processing of samples in two batches was due to logistics of patients recruitment in the project. RNA quality control and quantification were assessed with the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Samples were depleted from ribosomal RNA using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal kit (Illumina) prior to cDNa synthesis and library preparation using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA (Illumina). Unlike strategies using polyadenylated transcripts selection, this method allowed to preserve non-polyadenylated transcripts including nascent pre-mRNA (unspliced) and functionally relevant lncRNAs. For each of the cohorts, all libraries were pooled together and sequenced over several lanes of HiSeq4000 aiming a depth of approximately 50 million total reads per sample to maintain an appropriate level of sensitivity for subsequent expression analysis, given the greater complexity of ribo-depleted libraries.

\subsubsection{Gene expression quantification by qPCR array}
Expression of immune-relevant genes was profiled by qPCR using the RT2 Profiler PCR Array (PAHS-3803Z, Qiagen) in collaboration with UCB. This platform included primers to test expression for 370 key genes involved in immune response during autoimmunity and inflammation, as well as appropriate house-keeping genes for normalisation. In brief, RNA was extracted, as detailed previously, from CD14$^+$ monocytes, mCD4$^+$ and mCD8$^+$ cells isolated in three PsA patients (Chapter \ref{ch:Results3} Table \ref{tab:PSA_datasets_per_sample}) and three healthy controls (UCB recruitment, confidential) by FACS. Retro-transcription for cDNA synthesis and qPCR gene expression quantification was performed by UCB following the PCR array's manufacturers instructions.  

\subsubsection{Single-cell RNA-seq} 
\label{scRNA_processing}
scRNA-seq data was generated using 10X Genomics technology Chromium single cell 3' expression library preparation kit (PN-120267) by the Oxford Genomics Centre at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. Briefly, PBMCs and SFMCs isolated from each of the three PsA patients (Chapter \ref{ch:Results3} Table \ref{tab:PSA_datasets_per_sample}) were made into a cell suspension. Approximately 3,000 cells from the PBMCs or SFMCs suspensions were partitioned into single-cell gel beads in emulsion (GEMs) using the 10X Chromium controller system. Retro-transcription for cDNA synthesis was performed within the GEMs, which included a 16bp 10x barcode, a 10bp unique molecular identifier (UMI) and poly-dT primers. The cDNA was released from the GEMs, followed by PCR amplification, enzymatic fragmentation and size selection. Afterward, appropriate sequencing Illumina indexes were incorporated into the samples through library preparation. Sequencing was performed using PE HiSeq4000 with 26pb for read 1 and 98bp for read 2 at a depth of approximately 50,000 reads per cell, following standard 10X library sequencing requirements. 




%\subsubsection{Small-bulk RNA-seq } 
%Between 100 to 500 cells of the five populations isolated from PsA patients were FACS sorted into 2$\micro$L of cell lysis buffer and processed for library prep as in Picelli \textit{et al.}, 2014 by the Oxford Genomics Centre at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. Libraries were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq4000 xxxx bp single-end at a depth of XXX reads per cell.


%\subsection{Single-cell analysis of the V(D)J T cell receptor repertoire}
%Single-cell sequencing of the V(D)J segments from TCR transcripts was performed simultaneously with the 10X Genomics technology Chromium 5' expression library kit (PN-1000014) by the Oxford Genomics Centre at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. In short, full-length cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers against the 5’ and 3’ ends of the barcode sequences inherent to the 10X Genomics bead technology. The amplified material was divided for use in 5' total scRNA-seq (as specified previously in \ref{scRNA_processing}) and also for enrichment of the TCR by PCR amplification with specific primers. TCR enriched cDNA was followed by enzymatic fragmentation and size selection in order to obtain variable length fragments spanning the V(D)J segments. Library prep and indexing was followed by Illumina HiSeq4000 xxxx bp single-end sequencing at a depth of XXX reads per cell.

\subsection{DNA extraction and SNP genotyping}
DNA isolation was performed using the AllPrep DNA/mRNA/microRNA Universal kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Basic quantification was performed using NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific) and kept at -80{$^\circ$}C for long term storage. For each of the patients and controls from cohort 1A and 1B (Chapter \ref{ch:Results2} Table \ref{tab:Psoriasis_cohort_metadata} and \ref{tab:Control_cohort_metadata}), the extracted DNA was amplify by PCR using forward (5'-CACTGTGGAGGGAGGAACAA-3') and reverse (5'-CGTGTTGGCCAGGATAGTCT-3') primers annealing up and down stream the SNP rs4672505, respectively. The 390bp PCR fragment was purified using MinElute PCR purification kit, quantified by dsDNA Qbit kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and prepared for Sanger sequencing using the Mix2Seq service (Eurofins). The forward and reverse sequences were analysed with BioEdit software.



\subsection{Mass cytometry using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)}
Mass cytometry assay was performed by Dr Nicole Yager in collaboration with UCB following their in-house protocol for the CyTOF instrument. Briefly, for each of the three PsA patients (Chapter \ref{ch:Results3} Table \ref{tab:PSA_datasets_per_sample}) an aliquot of whole blood and SF were fixed for 5 min with 1.6\% PFA within 30 min of venipuncture/aspiration, respectively. These samples were defined as time 0h. In addition, another aliquot of whole blood and SF were incubated at 37{$^\circ$}C for 6h in the presence of the protein transport inhibitors mix 1X BD GolgiStop (BD) and 1X BD GolgiPlug (BD), containing monesin and brefeldin A, respectively. Treatment with monensin and brefeldin A prevented the extracellular transport of cytokines from the cells and allowed measuring the intrinsic cytokine production rate in basal conditions. After 5h 45 mins the samples were treated with cisplatin to facilitate discrimination of dead cells, and then fixed 5 min with 1.6\% PFA. These samples were defined as time 6h. After fixation of time 0h or 6h samples, red blood cells were lysed and cell suspensions were washed with PBS and stained with Abs against the cell surface markers of the intra-cellular staining (ICS) panel (Table \ref{tab:CyTOF}). The samples were further permeabilised and stained with Abs of the ICS panel against the intracellular targets (Table \ref{tab:CyTOF}).

\section{Computational and statistical analysis}

\subsection{ATAC-seq, Fast-ATAC and Omni-ATAC data analysis}
\label{ATAC_analysis}
ATAC-seq, Fast-ATAC and Omni-ATAC data were analysed using an in house pipeline towards which development I made an important contribution. The pipeline performs single sample data processing and it also builds a combined master list for each of the comparisons of interest to later perform chromatin accessibility characterisation and differential analysis. 

\subsubsection{Next generation sequencing data analysis}
NGS data for each of the samples was trimmed for low quality base pairs and Nextera adapter sequences using cutadapt \parencite{} before general QC assessment using fastqc \parencite{Andrews2010}. Trimmed reads were aligned to the reference genome built hg19 using bowtie2 \parencite{Langmead2006} and the following parameters -k 4 -X 2000 -I 38 --mm -1, consistently with other publications \parencite{Buenrostro2013, Corces2016}. Samtools \parencite{} was used to remove PCR duplicate reads previously marked with Picard Tools \parencite{} as well as low MAPQ (${<}$30) non-uniquely and non-properly paired reads. The resulting bam file was additional filtered to remove mitochondrial DNA and reads were adjusted by +4bp in the plus strand and by -5bp in the minus strand to represent the center of the transposition binding event. Pileup tracks (bigWig files) representing the number of reads per bp position  were generated using bedtools genomeCoverageBed \parencite{} and the UCSC genome browser bedGraphToBigWig tool \parencite{}. When used for visualisation purposes, normalised bigWig files were generated from normalised bedgraph files using bedtools genomecov and the factor size calculated by DESeq2, in order to account for differences in library size. 

\subsubsection{Peak calling, filtering and sample quality assessment}
Peak calling was performed using MACS2  callpeak \parencite{} and the parametres --nomodel --shift -100 --extsize 200 --p 0.1 --keep-dup all --call-summits and filtered for those overlapping with the blacklisted features from ENCODE project \parencite{}. The --shift and --extsize parameters were set according to the recommendations of MACS2 for DHS and following other ATAC-seq publications \parencite{Buenrostro2015, Corces2016}. The pval cut off for filtering called peaks was determine for each of the cell types separately using Irreproducibility Discovery Rate (IDR) analysis (as further detailed in Chapter \ref:{ch:Results1}). For this, the filtered bam file of each sample was partitioned in two (pseudorreplicates. Peak calling was performed in each of the pseudorreplicates, followed by filtering for a range of pval (from 0 to 10$^-45$) and IDR analysis for the resulting pairs of filtered peak sets. For each of the filtering pval, the percentage of peaks sharing IDR rank consistency between the two pseudorreplicates was determined. The optimal pval for peak filtering was the pval presenting the greatest percentage of peaks sharing IDR ranking between the two pseudorreplicates. When more than one summit was identified in a peak, it was replaced by the median of the summits. For all the peaks, summits were extended +/- 250bp to create a non-overlapping homogenous 500bp peak list for each sample \parencite{Buenrostro2015, Corces2016}. 

Sample quality was determined by the fold change enrichment of ATAC-seq signal across all the TSS identified by Ensembl, since chromatin is expected to be more accessible at the sites of transcriptional initiation compared to the flanking regions. Fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP) was calculated only for samples in Chapter \ref{ch:Results1} as the overlap between the peak list filtered for standard FDR$<$0.01 and the ATAC-seq fragment file using bedtools intersect with the parameter --f 0.1.

\subsubsection{Combined peak master list and differential analysis}
To perform differential open chromatin analysis a non-overlapping 500bp peak master list including all the samples to contrast in a particular differential analysis was built. In Chapter \ref{ch:Results1} individual master lists were built for combined CD14$^+$ monocytes and CD4$^+$ cells, combined fresh, fixed and frozen CD14$^+$ monocytes and combined fresh, fixed and frozen CD4$^+$ cells. In Chapter \ref{ch:Results2} a master list was built for each cell type including psoriasis and control samples. Lastly, in Chapter \ref{ch:Results3} a master list was built for each cell type including SF and PB samples from the same three individuals. 

Each master list containing 500bp peaks was built by union of all the peaks present in at least 30\% of the samples included in a particular contrast, regardless the group they belonged to (e.g patients or controls, SF or PB). Reads overlapping each of those peaks were retrieved for each sample using HTSeq-count algorithm \parencite{} to generate a count matrix. An empirical 80\% confidence cut-off to account for high bckground reads in absent peaks was calculated on the raw count matrix and used to filter out some peaks in the master list before proceeding to the differential analysis (detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:Results1})(\parencite{Xinmin2005,Jonker2014}). Differential analysis was performed using DESeq2 v1.20 R package \parencite{Love2014} taking into account paired samples (in Chapter \ref{ch:Results1} and Chapter \ref{ch:Results3}) or correcting for the covariate batch (in Chapter \ref{ch:Results1}).
A combined master list for all cell types and tissues (when applicable) was built following the same strategy, counts retrieved and normalised and used for principal component analysis (PCA). 



\subsection{ChIPm data analysis}

\subsubsection{Next generation sequencing data analysis}
ChIPm NGS data from samples and inputs were processed similarly to ATAC-seq (see Section ATAC-seq, Fast-ATAC and Omni-ATAC data analysis) for trimming, mapping and filtering with minor modifications. Particularly, the MAPQ30 score for filtering reads was lowered to 10. For visualisation, ChIPm samples bedgraph files with subtracted noise from the control input were generated using MACS2 bdgcmp -m subtract followed by conversion to bigWig with bedGraphToBigWig tools.

\subsubsection{Peak calling, filtering and sample quality}
Peak calling for each ChIPm sample was performed accounting for background signal using the control input samples with MACS2 callpeak --bw 200 --p 0.1 --keep-dup all --call-summits. In this case the average library fragment size (--bw) was used by MACS2 to first empirically find the model that better represent the precise protein-DNA interaction and calculate the appropriate --shift parameter. For ChIPm PCA analysis, filtering and down stream peak homogenisation was performed similarly to Section \ref(ATAC_analysis) to build a combined master list for all the samples and cell types from cohort 1B (Chapter \ref{ch:Results2} Table \ref{tab:Psoriasis_cohort_metadata} and \ref{tab:Control_cohort_metadata}).

Sample quality was determined by the combination of a series of measurements. For library complexity the non-redundant fraction (NRF) and PCR bottleneck coefficients (PBC1 and PBC2) were calculated following ENCODE guidelines (https://www.encodeproject.org/chip-seq/histone/) from unfiltered bam files.  Enrichment of the ChIPm signal was evaluated based on the calculated normalised strand cross-correlation coefficient (NSC) and relative strand cross-correlation coefficient (RSC) by the cross-correlation analysis with SPP using bam files filtered for low MAPQ30, duplicated and non-properly paired.

\subsubsection{Combined peak master list and differential analysis}
DiffBind (mostly with default parameters) was used to build a peak master list and perform differential H3K27ac analysis between psoriasis patients and healthy controls for each individual cell type. DiffBind used the unfiltered sample peak files generated by MACS2 and the filtered bam files (from samples and control inputs) to generate a master list including high quality reproducible peaks present in at least 50\% of the samples (modification from default parameters) and retrieve counts of the reads mapping at the location of each of the peaks.

\subsection{Annotation of chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac modified regions using chromatin segmentation maps}



\subsection{RNA-seq data analysis}

\subsubsection{Bulk RNA-seq analysis}
The ribo-depleted RNA-seq data generated was mapped using the aligner STAR \parencite{Dobin2013} against the Gencode hg19 annotation file containing reference chromosomes, scaffolds and assembly patches. The annotation file comprised 2,840,278 gene entities, including lnc-RNAs. Mapping allowed multiple alignments and only retained those with the best score and a miss-match percentage lower than 0.04\%. Duplicates were marked and removed using Picard Tools. The filtered de-duplicated and sorted bam files were used to retrieve counts at each of the genes location of the annotation file using HTSeq-count. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 v1.20 R package filtering out those genes with five or less reads in at least eight samples (smallest group size corresponding to the psoriasis patients' samples). Independent filtering of genes with unreliable expression levels to reduce multiple testing, outliers removal using Cook's distance and moderation of log$_2$FC were enabled when using DESeq2. Differentially expressed transcripts were filtered based on FDR$<$0.05 or FDR$<0.01$, depending on the downstream analysis. Batch effect was included as covariate in in the DESeq2 model to perform the DGE analysis between psoriasis patients and healthy controls for the four cell types of interest isolated from PBMCs. This effect related to the RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing of the cohort 1A and cohort 1B samples from psoriasis study (including healthy controls), which were conducted in two different batches.Lnc-RNAs were annotated using the list provided by gencode.v19 (https://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html). The design of the psoriasis skin DGE analysis consisting of paired lesional and uninvolved skin biopsies obtained from each patient was taken into account by the DESeq2 model to increase the power of the analysis.



\subsubsection{Single-cell RNA-seq analysis}
scRNA-seq generated with 10X for bulk PBMCs and SFMCs from three PsA patients (see \ref{ch:Results3}) were processed using Seurat R package \parencite()
PBMCs and SFMCs individual libraries filtered for less than 7.5\% MT and 500 to mean nGenes+1SD, approximately 1,800 genes per cell across the 6 libraries,




\subsection{Genomic region annotation, pathway enrichment analysis and visualisation}
Annotation of genomic regions and signalling-pathways visualisation were performed with two functionalities of the R package and web-app Atlas and Analysis of systems-biology-led pathways, developed by Dr. Hai Fang and towards which I have made some contribution (manuscript in preparation). ATAC-seq and ChIPm peaks were annotated with gene entities based on publicly available promoter-HiC data in 17 immune cell types \parencite{Javierre2016}. The interactions were weighted based on the number of cell types for which the same bait-target interaction was reported as well as on the confidence of each of those interaction measured by the CHiCAGO score. This approach integrates the knowledge in the field about regulatory regions affecting the expression of distal genes and was not biased by the physical vicinity to a gene when annotating genomic intervals located at intergenic regions or gene desserts.For visualisation, manually curated KEGG pathways including all the genes for each gene family were colored based on the fold-change from the corresponding differential analysis and highlighted in bold when passing the FDR threshold for significance.

 \subsection{Enrichment analysis for genomic annotation features}

-ATAC all peaks enrichment for GWAS
-ATAC for TFBS, chromatin annotation segments
GWAS with eQTL and DOCs using xLDenricher with co-localisation and permutation analysis 20,000


\subsection{Mass cytometry data analysis}
Mass cytometry analysis was performed by Dr Nicole Yager. Mean expression of cytokine release was calculated following unsupervised clustering analysis guided by a workflow similar to Nowicka \textit{et al.} with minor modifications \parencite{Nowicka 2017}. For each population of cells, cytokine production in SF and PB was calculated as the difference in the mean signal intensity between the 0h and 6h aliquots. Mean was chosen due to the extremely small changes observed when calculating median intensities. The percentage of cytokine release was calculated following manual gating for the CD14$^+$ population based on surface marker expression.  The percentage of TNF-$\alpha$ positive staining cells were calculated between the 0h and the 6h samples within each tissue.


\subsection{Statistical fine-mapping}


Fine mapping of the psoriasis and PsA GWAS signals was performed using a Bayesian approach, aiming to overcome the incomplete coverage of the genotyping arrays and the hundreds of associations per locus due to the LD structure of the genome. Fine-mapping was conducted using two different strategies upon availability of summary statistics or genotyping data from the psoriasis and PsA Immunochip GWAS studies, respectively. Both strategies include the same main steps of imputation, association testing and calculation of PP and were implemented in collaboration with Dr Adri\'{a}n Cort\'{e}s.

\subsubsection{PsA fine-mapping using Immunochip genotyping data}
Fine-mapping was performed for a subset of twenty-two non-MHC PsA Immunochip GWAS susceptibility loci previously selected by Bowes \textit{et al.} based on the lead SNP FDR$<$10$^-4$ and a marker density in the region of at least 100 SNPs.  The analysis was performed using 1,103 patients and 8,900 controls from the Bowes {et al.} PsA Immunochip UK cohort. Access to the data post-quality control was kindly provided by Dr Anne Baton (Manchester University). PCA analysis was performed using only pruned SNPs with flashpca \parencite{Abraham2014} and the calculated PCs were used as covariates into the association analysis to correct for population stratification. 

For each of the fine-mapped loci a 2Mb window from the lead SNP was defined and SNPs extracted from the data using PLINK 1.9 \parencite{Chang2015}. Phasing of the genotype data from that region was performed with SHAPEIT \parencite{Delaneau2012} and afterward used to impute missing genotypes with IMPUTE2 \parencite{Howie2009} and the 1000 Genomes Project Version 3 as the reference panel (October 2015 release). SNPs for which imputation was not successful in at least 70\% of the samples (info-score$<$0.7) were filtered out using QCtool and removed for downstream analysis to avoid confounders in the association analysis.

The association and conditional analysis was conducted using a Bayesian additive model implemented with SNPTEST and the PCs previously calculated as covariates to regress in the model \parencite{Burton2007}. Approximated Bayes Factor (ABF) was calculated for the lead signal and step-wise conditional analysis was performed if ABF$>$4. Credible sets of SNPs containing the variants more likely to explain 50\% and 90\% of that association were provided for each of the signals in the locus, along with their corresponding posterior probabilities (PP) as further detailed in Bunt \textit{et al.}, 2015.



\subsubsection{Psoriasis fine-mapping using Immunochip summary statistics data}
In the case of the psoriasis fine mapping was performed for X of the risk loci reported by the psoriasis Immunochip GWAS study from Tsoi \textit{et al.}, 2012. To conduct fine mapping only access to the summary statistics of the GAPC Immunochip cohort (2,997 cases and 9,183 controls) from Tsoi \textit{et al.}, 2012  was available. The summary statistics file included the pval and the OR calculated for each of the genotyped SNPs using a logarithmic regression model and correcting for ten principal components. Due to the restrained accessibility to genotyping data for ethical reasons, statistical methods have been developed to perform imputation of the summary statistics instead of the actual genotype for missing SNPs. In this case, the statistic z-scores from the genotyped SNPs were used by direct imputation of summary statistics (DIST) method to impute the z-scores for allele 1 of the missing SNPs based on the correlation in linkage disequilibrium (r$^2$) from the 1000 Genome Project Version 3 \parencite{Lee2013}. Imputation was performed genome-wide for all the twenty-two autosomes and the results were filtered based on the quality of the imputation using threshold score$>$ 0.8.

After imputation of the summary statistics, association analysis and calculation of the ABF were performed using Wakefield approximation for a 2Mb window around the GWAS lead SNP of each locus of interest. This approximation was applied under the priors of  (1) normally distributed OR with mean and variance (v$^$2); (2) the greater the variance the bigger the size effects will be obtained; (3) mean is 0 and variance is fixed to 0.2 (accepted variance for GWAS studies). In this approach ABF was calculated using effect size (\beta) and standard error (SE) derived from the variance formula. $\beta$ was calculated using the z-scores of each of the interrogated SNPs as: $\beta$=z-score*SE. It is important to note that step-wise conditional analysis is not performed when using summary statistics imputation. Similarly to the genotyping fine-mapping approach, PP for the SNPs in a particular window (signal) were calculated and ranked to set the threshold of the 50 and 90 \% credible set of SNPs.
